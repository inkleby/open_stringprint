Their joint Memorandum of 24 February called for a programme of continued and reinforced inspections with a clear timeline and a military build-up to exert maximum pressure on Iraq to disarm.The reports to the Security Council by the IAEA reported increasing indications of Iraqi co-operation. On 7 March, Dr ElBaradei reported that there was no indication that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities and that it should be able to provide the Security Council with an assessment of Iraq&#39;s activities in the near future.page:114Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on 7 March that there had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq and, while they did not constitute immediate co-operation, they were welcome. UNMOVIC would be proposing a work programme for the Security Council&#39;s approval, based on key tasks for Iraq to address. It would take months to verify sites and items, analyse documents, interview relevant personnel and draw conclusions.A revised draft US, UK and Spanish resolution, tabled after the reports by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March and proposing a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to demonstrate full co-operation, also failed to attract support.China, France and Russia all stated that they did not favour a resolution authorising the use of force and that the Security Council should maintain its efforts to find a peaceful solution.Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that a &quot;&quot;side statement&quot;&quot; with defined benchmarks for Iraqi co-operation could be needed to secure support from Mexico and Chile.Mr Blair told President Bush that he would need a majority of nine votes in the Security Council for Parliamentary approval for UK military action.", "tags": "", "url": "key-findings.html#12.298.o4vd2.lduq5.empex.kolsf"},

There is no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 improperly influenced the text.The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt either that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons or that efforts to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC should have made that clear to Mr Blair.In his statement to Parliament on 24 September 2002, Mr Blair presented Iraq&#39;s past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq&#39;s weapons of mass destruction; and that at some point in the future that threat would become a reality.The dossier&#39;s description of Iraq&#39;s capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK Government measured Iraq&#39;s future statements and actions and the success of weapons inspections.The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the firmness of the evidence has produced a damaging legacy which may make it more difficult to secure support for Government policy, including military action, where the evidence depends on inferential judgements drawn from intelligence.There are lessons which should be implemented in using information from JIC Assessments to underpin policy decisions.page:116", "tags": "", "url": "key-findings.html#12.8912.pdexq.toqmp.itdat.l7bfv"},

The UK participated in both.As the insurgency developed, the ISG&#39;s operating conditions became increasingly difficult. There was competition for resources between counter-terrorism operations and the search for WMD evidence, and some ISG staff were diverted to the former.page:117Mr Blair took a close interest in the work of the ISG and the presentation of its reports and the wider narrative about WMD. He raised the subject with President Bush.The Government was confident that pre-conflict assessments of Iraq&#39;s WMD capabilities would be confirmed once Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime had been removed.It quickly became apparent that it was unlikely that significant stockpiles would be found. This led to challenges to the credibility of both the Government and the intelligence community.There were soon demands for an independent judge-led inquiry into the pre-conflict intelligence.The Government was quick to acknowledge the need for a review, rejecting an independent inquiry in favour of reviews initiated by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.The Government&#39;s reluctance to establish an independent public inquiry became untenable in January 2004 when President Bush announced his own decision to set up an independent inquiry in the US.Faced with criticism of the pre-conflict intelligence and the absence of evidence of a current Iraqi WMD capability, Mr Blair sought to defend the decision to take military action by emphasising instead:Saddam Hussein&#39;s strategic intent;the regime&#39;s breaches of Security Council resolutions; andthe positive impact of military action in Iraq on global counter-proliferation&amp;#61472;efforts.The ISG&#39;s principal findings &amp;#8211; that Iraq&#39;s WMD capability had mostly been destroyed in 1991 but that it had been Saddam Hussein&#39;s strategic intent to preserve the capability to reconstitute his WMD &amp;#8211; were significant, but did not support statements made by the UK and US Governments before the invasion, which had focused on Iraq&#39;s current capabilities and an urgent and growing threat.The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 drew on the ISG&#39;s findings, but was not the explanation given before the conflict.", "tags": "", "url": "key-findings.html#12.454.gxsux.imove.y_fdq.hatc4"},

Lord Goldsmith was asked, after the meeting, by Admiral Boyce on behalf of the Armed Forces, and by the Treasury Solicitor, Ms Juliet Wheldon, in respect of the Civil Service, to give a clear-cut answer on whether military action would be lawful rather than unlawful.Lord Goldsmith concluded on 13 March that, on balance, the &quot;&quot;better view&quot;&quot; was that the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this case, meaning that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further resolution beyond resolution 1441.Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on 14 March:", "tags": "", "url": "key-findings.html#12.1454.jy2nu.shwim.xssgq.pe7co"},

The US wanted some UK capabilities (including Special Forces), to use UK bases, and the involvement of the UK military to avoid the perception of unilateral US military action. The primary impetus to maximise the size of the UK contribution and the recommendations on its composition came from the Armed Forces, with the agreement of Mr Hoon.From late February 2002, the UK judged that Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime could only be removed by a US-led invasion.In April 2002, the MOD advised that, if the US mounted a major military operation, the UK should contribute a division comprising three brigades. That was perceived to be commensurate with the UK&#39;s capabilities and the demands of the campaign. Anything smaller risked being compared adversely to the UK&#39;s contribution to the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.The MOD saw a significant military contribution as a means of influencing US decisions.page:120Mr Blair and Mr Hoon wanted to keep open the option of contributing significant forces for ground operations as long as possible, but between May and mid-October consistently pushed back against US assumptions that the UK would provide a division.Air and maritime forces were offered to the US for planning purposes in September.The MOD advised in October that the UK was at risk of being excluded from US plans unless it offered ground forces, &quot;&quot;Package 3&quot;&quot;, on the same basis as air and maritime forces. That could also significantly reduce the UK&#39;s vulnerability to US requests to provide a substantial and costly contribution to post-conflict operations.From August until December 2002, other commitments meant that UK planning for Package 3 was based on providing a divisional headquarters and an armoured brigade for operations in northern Iraq. That was seen as the maximum practicable contribution the UK could generate within the predicted timescales for US action.The deployment was dependent on Turkey&#39;s agreement to the transit of UK forces.Mr Blair agreed to offer Package 3 on 31 October 2002.That decision and its potential consequences were not formally considered by a Cabinet Committee or reported to Cabinet.In December 2002, the deployment of 3 Commando Brigade was identified as a way for the UK to make a valuable contribution in the initial stages of a land campaign if transit through Turkey was refused. The operational risks were not explicitly addressed.Following a visit to Turkey on 7 to 8 January 2003, Mr Hoon concluded that there would be no agreement to the deployment of UK ground forces through Turkey.By that time, in any case, the US had asked the UK to deploy for operations in southern Iraq.", "tags": "", "url": "key-findings.html#12.9967.qcpps.px1hy.e1tkw.g9vf3"},
