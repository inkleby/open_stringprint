id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p><em>This version of <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/">The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</a> (Chilcot Report) has been reformatted for web using <a href="http://www.stringprint.com">StringPrint</a>. Minor formatting changes throughout.</em></p><p>In 2003, for the first time since the Second World War, the United Kingdom took part in an opposed invasion and full-scale occupation of a sovereign State – Iraq. Cabinet decided on 17 March to join the US-led invasion of Iraq, assuming there was no last-minute capitulation by Saddam Hussein. That decision was ratified by Parliament the next day and implemented the night after that.</p><p>Until 28 June 2004, the UK was a joint Occupying Power in Iraq. For the next five years, UK forces remained in Iraq with responsibility for security in the South-East; and the UK sought to assist with stabilisation and reconstruction.</p><p>The consequences of the invasion and of the conflict within Iraq which followed are still being felt in Iraq and the wider Middle East, as well as in the UK. It left families bereaved and many individuals wounded, mentally as well as physically. After harsh deprivation under Saddam Hussein's regime, the Iraqi people suffered further years of violence.</p><p>The decision to use force – a very serious decision for any government to take – provoked profound controversy in relation to Iraq and became even more controversial when it was subsequently found that Iraq's programmes to develop and produce chemical, biological and nuclear weapons had been dismantled. It continues to shape debates on national security policy and the circumstances in which to intervene.</p><p>Although the Coalition had achieved the removal of a brutal regime which had defied the United Nations and which was seen as a threat to peace and security, it failed to achieve the goals it had set for a new Iraq. Faced with serious disorder in Iraq, aggravated by sectarian differences, the US and UK struggled to contain the situation. The lack of security impeded political, social and economic reconstruction.</p><p>The Inquiry's report sets out in detail decision-making in the UK Government covering the period from when the possibility of military action first arose in 2001 to the departure of UK troops in 2009. It covers many different aspects of policy and its delivery.</p><p>In this Executive Summary the Inquiry sets out its conclusions on a number of issues that have been central to the controversies surrounding Iraq. In addition to the factors that shaped the decision to take military action in March 2003 without support for an authorising resolution in the UN Security Council, they are: the assessments of Iraqi WMD capabilities by the intelligence community prior to the invasion (including their presentation in the September 2002 dossier); advice on whether military action would be legal; the lack of adequate preparation for the post-conflict period and the consequent struggle to cope with the deteriorating security situation in Iraq after the invasion. This Summary also contains the Inquiry's key findings and a compilation of lessons, from the conclusions of individual Sections of the report.</p><p>Other Sections of the report contain detailed accounts of the relevant decisions and events, and the Inquiry's full conclusions and lessons.</p><p>The following are extracts from the main body of the Report covering some of the most important issues considered by the Inquiry.</p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2 id="preconflict-strategy-and-planning">Pre-conflict strategy and planning</h2><p>After the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 and the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in November, the US Administration turned its attention to regime change in Iraq as part of the second phase of what it called the Global War on Terror.</p><p>The UK Government sought to influence the decisions of the US Administration and avoid unilateral US military action on Iraq by offering partnership to the US and seeking to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat with which it was necessary to deal.</p><p>In Mr Blair's view, the decision to stand <span class="quote">"shoulder to shoulder"</span> with the US was an essential demonstration of solidarity with the UK's principal ally as well as being in the UK's long-term national interests.</p><p>To do so required the UK to reconcile its objective of disarming Iraq, if possible by peaceful means, with the US goal of regime change. That was achieved by the development of an ultimatum strategy threatening the use of force if Saddam Hussein did not comply with the demands of the international community, and by seeking to persuade the US to adopt that strategy and pursue it through the UN.</p><p>President Bush's decision, in September 2002, to challenge the UN to deal with Iraq, and the subsequent successful negotiation of resolution 1441 giving Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations or face serious consequences if it did not, was perceived to be a major success for Mr Blair's strategy and his influence on President Bush.</p><p>But US willingness to act through the UN was limited. Following the Iraqi declaration of 7 December 2002, the UK perceived that President Bush had decided that the US would take military action in early 2003 if Saddam Hussein had not been disarmed and was still in power.</p><p>The timing of military action was entirely driven by the US Administration.</p><p>At the end of January 2003, Mr Blair accepted the US timetable for military action by mid-March. President Bush agreed to support a second resolution to help Mr Blair.</p><p>The UK Government's efforts to secure a second resolution faced opposition from those countries, notably France, Germany and Russia, which believed that the inspections process could continue. The inspectors reported that Iraqi co-operation, while far from perfect, was improving.</p><p>By early March, the US Administration was not prepared to allow inspections to continue or give Mr Blair more time to try to achieve support for action. The attempt to gain support for a second resolution was abandoned.</p><p>In the Inquiry's view, the diplomatic options had not at that stage been exhausted. Military action was therefore not a last resort.</p><p>In mid-March, Mr Blair's determination to stand alongside the US left the UK with a stark choice. It could act with the US but without the support of the majority of the Security Council in taking military action if Saddam Hussein did not accept the US ultimatum giving him 48 hours to leave. Or it could choose not to join US-led military action.</p><p>Led by Mr Blair, the UK Government chose to support military action.</p><p>Mr Blair asked Parliament to endorse a decision to invade and occupy a sovereign nation, without the support of a Security Council resolution explicitly authorising the use of force. Parliament endorsed that choice.</p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2 id="the-uk-decision-to-support-us-military-action">The UK decision to support US military action</h2><p>President Bush decided at the end of 2001 to pursue a policy of regime change in Iraq.</p><p>The UK shared the broad objective of finding a way to deal with Saddam Hussein's defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and his assumed weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. However, based on consistent legal advice, the UK could not share the US objective of regime change. The UK Government therefore set as its objective the disarmament of Iraq in accordance with the obligations imposed in a series of Security Council resolutions.</p><h3 id="uk-policy-before-911">UK policy before 9/11</h3><p>Before the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 (9/11), the UK was pursuing a strategy of containment based on a new sanctions regime to improve international support and incentivise Iraq's co-operation, narrowing and deepening the sanctions regime to focus only on prohibited items and at the same time improving financial controls to reduce the flow of illicit funds to Saddam Hussein.</p><p>When UK policy towards Iraq was formally reviewed and agreed by the Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy (DOP) in May 1999, the objectives towards Iraq were defined as:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam poses to the region including by eliminating his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes; and, in the longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law-abiding member of the international community."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The policy of containment was seen as the <span class="quote">"only viable way"</span> to pursue those objectives. A <span class="quote">"policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international support"</span>. Iraq was unlikely to accept the package immediately but <span class="quote">"might be persuaded to acquiesce eventually"</span>.</p><p>After prolonged discussion about the way ahead, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1284 in December 1999, although China, France and Russia abstained.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-2-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>The resolution established:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>a new inspectorate, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) (which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed to lead);</p></li><li><p>a timetable to identify and agree a work programme; and</p></li><li><p>the principle that, if the inspectors reported co-operation in key areas, that would lead to the suspension of economic sanctions.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-3-ref"><sup>3</sup></a></p></li></ul><p></p><p>Resolution 1284 described Iraq's obligations to comply with the disarmament standards of resolution 687 and other related resolutions as the <span class="quote">"governing standard of Iraqi compliance"</span>; and provided that the Security Council would decide what was required of Iraq for the implementation of each task and that it should be <span class="quote">"clearly defined and precise"</span>.</p><p>The resolution was also a deliberate compromise which changed the criterion for the suspension, and eventual lifting, of sanctions from complete disarmament to tests which would be based on judgements by UNMOVIC on the progress made in completing identified tasks.</p><p>Iraq refused to accept the provisions of resolution 1284, including the re-admission of weapons inspectors. Concerns about Iraq's activities in the absence of inspectors increased.</p><p>The US Presidential election in November 2000 prompted a further UK review of the operation of the containment policy (see Section 1.2). There were concerns about how long the policy could be sustained and what it could achieve.</p><p>There were also concerns over both the continued legal basis for operations in the No-Fly Zones (NFZs) and the conduct of individual operations.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-4-ref"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>In an Assessment on 1 November, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) judged that Saddam Hussein felt <span class="quote">"<strong>little pressure to negotiate</strong> over ... resolution 1284 because the proceeds of oil smuggling and illicit trade have increased significantly this year, and more countries are increasing diplomatic contacts and trade with Iraq"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-5-ref"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>The JIC also judged:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Saddam would only contemplate co-operation with [resolution] 1284, and the return of inspectors ... if it could be portrayed as a victory. He will not agree to co-operate unless:</p><ul><li><p>there is a <strong>UN-agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions</strong>. Saddam suspects that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained in power;</p></li><li><p>he is <strong>able to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection provisions</strong>. His ambitions to rebuild Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any other constraints likely to be effective.</p></li></ul><p>"Before accepting 1284, Saddam will try to obtain the abolition of the No-Fly Zones. He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the Iraqi regime."</p><p></p></blockquote><p>In November 2000, Mr Blair's <span class="quote">"preferred option"</span> was described as the implementation of 1284, enabling inspectors to return and sanctions to be suspended.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-6-ref"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>In December 2000, the British Embassy Washington reported growing pressure to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by President Clinton.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-7" id="footnote-7-ref"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>The Key Judgements of a JIC Assessment in February 2001 included:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>There was <span class="quote">"broad international consensus to <strong>maintain the arms embargo</strong> at least as long as Saddam remains in power. <strong>Saddam faces no economic pressure to accept</strong>... [resolution]<strong>1284 because he is successfully undermining the economic sanctions regime</strong>."</span></p></li><li><p><span class="quote">"Through abuse of the UN Oil-for-Food [OFF] programme and smuggling of oil and other goods"</span> it was estimated that Saddam Hussein would <span class="quote">"<strong>be able to appropriate in the region of $1.5bn to $1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001</strong>"</span>, and there was <span class="quote">"scope for earning even more"</span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="quote">"<strong>Iranian</strong> interdiction efforts"</span> had <span class="quote">"<strong>significantly reduced smuggling down the Gulf</strong>"</span>, but Saddam Hussein had <span class="quote">"compensated by <strong>exploiting land routes</strong> to Turkey and Syria"</span>.</p></li><li><p><span class="quote">"<strong>Most countries</strong>"</span> believed that economic sanctions were <span class="quote">"<strong>ineffective, counterproductive and should now be lifted</strong>. Without active enforcement, the economic sanctions regime"</span> would <span class="quote">"continue to erode"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-8-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></p></li></ul><p></p><p>The Assessment also stated:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Saddam Hussein needed funds <span class="quote">"to maintain his military and security apparatus and secure its loyalty"</span>.</p></li><li><p>Despite the availability of funds, Iraq had been slow to comply with UN recommendations on food allocation. Saddam needed <span class="quote">"<strong>the Iraqi people to suffer to underpin his campaign against sanctions</strong>"</span>.</p></li><li><p>Encouraged by the success of Iraq's border trade agreement with Turkey, <span class="quote">"<strong>front-line states</strong>"</span> were <span class="quote">"<strong>not enforcing sanctions</strong>"</span>.</p></li><li><p>There had been a <span class="quote">"<strong>significant increase in the erosion of sanctions</strong> over the past six months"</span>.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>When Mr Blair had his first meeting with President Bush at Camp David in late February 2001, the US and UK agreed on the need for a policy which was more widely supported in the Middle East region.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-9-ref"><sup>9</sup></a> Mr Blair had concluded that public presentation needed to be improved. He suggested that the approach should be presented as a <span class="quote">"deal"</span> comprising four elements:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel;</p></li><li><p>tighten weapons controls on Saddam Hussein;</p></li><li><p>retain financial control on Saddam Hussein; and</p></li><li><p>retain our ability to strike.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The stated position of the UK Government in February 2001 was that containment had been broadly successful.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-10-ref"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>During the summer of 2001, the UK had been exploring the way forward with the US, Russia and France on a draft Security Council resolution to put in place a <span class="quote">"smart sanctions"</span> regime.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-11" id="footnote-11-ref"><sup>11</sup></a> But there was no agreement on the way ahead between the UK, the US, China, France and Russia, the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council.</p><p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, until 11 September 2001, the UK had a policy of containment, but sanctions were eroding.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-12" id="footnote-12-ref"><sup>12</sup></a> The policy was <span class="quote">"partially successful"</span>, but it did not mean that Saddam Hussein was <span class="quote">"not still developing his [prohibited] programmes"</span>.</p><h3 id="the-impact-of-911">The impact of 9/11</h3><p>The attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 changed perceptions about the severity and likelihood of the threat from international terrorism. They showed that attacks intended to cause large-scale civilian casualties could be mounted anywhere in the world.</p><p>In response to that perception of a greater threat, governments felt a responsibility to act to anticipate and reduce risks before they turned into a threat. That was described to the Inquiry by a number of witnesses as a change to the <span class="quote">"calculus of risk"</span> after 9/11.</p><p>In the wake of the attacks, Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand <span class="quote">"shoulder to shoulder"</span> with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-13" id="footnote-13-ref"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>The JIC assessed on 18 September that the attacks on the US had <span class="quote">"set a new benchmark for terrorist atrocity"</span>, and that terrorists seeking comparable impact might try to use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear devices.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-14" id="footnote-14-ref"><sup>14</sup></a> Only Islamic extremists such as those who shared Usama Bin Laden's agenda had the motivation to pursue attacks with the deliberate aim of causing maximum casualties.</p><p>Throughout the autumn of 2001, Mr Blair took an active and leading role in building a coalition to act against that threat, including military action against Al Qaida and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. He also emphasised the potential risk of terrorists acquiring and using nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, and the dangers of inaction.</p><p>In November 2001, the JIC assessed that Iraq had played no role in the 9/11 attacks on the US and that practical co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was <span class="quote">"unlikely"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-15" id="footnote-15-ref"><sup>15</sup></a> There was no <span class="quote">"credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology and expertise to terrorist groups"</span>. It was possible that Iraq might use WMD in terrorist attacks, but only if the regime was under serious and imminent threat of collapse.</p><p>The UK continued actively to pursue a strengthened policy of containing Iraq, through a revised and more targeted sanctions regime and seeking Iraq's agreement to the return of inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999).</p><p>The adoption on 29 November 2001 of resolution 1382 went some way towards that objective. But support for economic sanctions was eroding and whether Iraq would ever agree to re-admit weapons inspectors and allow them to operate without obstruction was in doubt.</p><p>Although there was no evidence of links between Iraq and Al Qaida, Mr Blair encouraged President Bush to address the issue of Iraq in the context of a wider strategy to confront terrorism after the attacks of 9/11. He sought to prevent precipitate military action by the US which he considered would undermine the success of the coalition which had been established for action against international terrorism.</p><p>President Bush's remarks<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-16" id="footnote-16-ref"><sup>16</sup></a> on 26 November renewed UK concerns that US attention was turning towards military action in Iraq.</p><p>Following a discussion with President Bush on 3 December, Mr Blair sent him a paper on a second phase of the war against terrorism.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-17" id="footnote-17-ref"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>On Iraq, Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq. This would build over time until the point was reached where <span class="quote">"military action could be taken if necessary"</span>, without losing international support.</p><p>The strategy was based on the premise that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with, and it had multiple diplomatic strands. It entailed renewed demands for Iraq to comply with the obligations imposed by the Security Council and for the re-admission of weapons inspectors, and a readiness to respond firmly if Saddam Hussein failed to comply.</p><p>Mr Blair did not, at that stage, have a ground invasion of Iraq or immediate military action of any sort in mind. The strategy included mounting covert operations in support of those <span class="quote">"with the ability to topple Saddam"</span>. But Mr Blair did state that, when a rebellion occurred, the US and UK should <span class="quote">"back it militarily"</span>.</p><p>That was the first step towards a policy of possible intervention in Iraq.</p><p>A number of issues, including the legal basis for any military action, would need to be resolved as part of developing the strategy.</p><p>The UK Government does not appear to have had any knowledge at that stage that President Bush had asked General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief, US Central Command, to review the military options for removing Saddam Hussein, including options for a conventional ground invasion.</p><p>Mr Blair also emphasised the threat which Iraq might pose in the future. That remained a key part of his position in the months that followed.</p><p>In his annual State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002, President Bush described the regimes in North Korea and Iran as <span class="quote">"sponsors of terrorism"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-18" id="footnote-18-ref"><sup>18</sup></a> He added that Iraq had continued to:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... flaunt its hostility towards America and to support terror ... The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens ...

That might be backed by a UN resolution.</p><p>Mr Blair thought it unlikely that Saddam Hussein intended to allow inspectors to return.

The inspectors are not needed to clean up the old remains. His weapons of mass destruction programme is active detailed and growing. The policy of containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not shut down; it is up and running now."</p><p></p></blockquote><p>Mr Blair posed, and addressed, three questions: <span class="quote">"Why Saddam?"</span>; <span class="quote">"Why now?"</span>; and <span class="quote">"Why should Britain care?"</span></p><p>On the question <span class="quote">"Why Saddam?"</span>, Mr Blair said that two things about Saddam Hussein stood out: <span class="quote">"He had used these weapons in Iraq"</span> and thousands had died, and he had used them during the war with Iran <span class="quote">"in which one million people died"</span>; and the regime had <span class="quote">"no moderate elements to appeal to"</span>.</p><p>On the question <span class="quote">"Why now?"</span>, Mr Blair stated:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"I agree I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam will use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act, will use diplomacy but not force.

In that period, the US Administration turned against a strategy of continued containment of Iraq, which it was pursuing before the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>This was not, initially, the view of the UK Government. Its stated view at that time was that containment had been broadly effective, and that it could be adapted in order to remain sustainable. Containment continued to be the declared policy of the UK throughout the first half of 2002.</p><p>The declared objectives of the UK and the US towards Iraq up to the time of the invasion differed. The US was explicitly seeking to achieve a change of regime; the UK to achieve the disarmament of Iraq, as required by UN Security Council resolutions.</p><p>Most crucially, the US Administration committed itself to a timetable for military action which did not align with, and eventually overrode, the timetable and processes for inspections in Iraq which had been set by the UN Security Council. The UK wanted UNMOVIC and the IAEA to have time to complete their work, and wanted the support of the Security Council, and of the international community more widely, before any further steps were taken. This option was foreclosed by the US decision.</p><p>On these and other important points, including the planning for the post-conflict period and the functioning of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), the UK Government decided that it was right or necessary to defer to its close ally and senior partner, the US.</p><p>It did so essentially for two reasons:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Concern that vital areas of co-operation between the UK and the US could be damaged if the UK did not give the US its full support over Iraq.</p></li><li><p>The belief that the best way to influence US policy towards the direction preferred by the UK was to commit full and unqualified support, and seek to persuade from the inside.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The UK Government was right to think very carefully about both of those points.</p><p>First, the close strategic alliance with the US has been a cornerstone of the UK's foreign and security policy under successive governments since the Second World War. Mr Blair rightly attached great importance to preserving and strengthening it.</p><p>After the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, that relationship was reinforced when Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand <span class="quote">"shoulder to shoulder"</span> with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-173" id="footnote-173-ref"><sup>173</sup></a> The action that followed in Afghanistan to bring about the fall of the Taliban served to strengthen and deepen the sense of shared endeavour.</p><p>When the US Administration turned its attention to regime change in Iraq as part of the second phase of the <span class="quote">"Global War on Terror"</span>, Mr Blair's immediate response was to seek to offer a partnership and to work with it to build international support for the position that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with.</p><p>In Mr Blair's view, the decision to stand alongside the US was in the UK's long-term national interests. In his speech of 18 March 2003, he argued that the handling of Iraq would:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation."</p><p></p></blockquote><p>In his memoir in 2010, Mr Blair wrote:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"I knew in the final analysis I would be with the US, because it was right morally and strategically.

Mr Hoon, for example, sought advice from Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, on the implications for the alliance of the UK's approach to Iraq.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-175" id="footnote-175-ref"><sup>175</sup></a></p><p>Although there has historically been a very close relationship between the British and American peoples and a close identity of values between our democracies, it is an alliance founded not on emotion, but on a hard-headed appreciation of mutual benefit. The benefits do not by any means flow only in one direction.</p><p>In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... I agreed with the basic US analysis of Saddam as a threat; I thought he was a monster; and to break the US partnership in such circumstances, when America's key allies were all rallying round, would in my view, then (and now) have done major long-term damage to that relationship."</p><p></p></blockquote><p>The Government was right to weigh the possible consequences for the wider alliance with the US very carefully, as previous Governments have done. A policy of direct opposition to the US would have done serious short-term damage to the relationship, but it is questionable whether it would have broken the partnership.</p><p>Over the past seven decades, the UK and US have adopted differing, and sometimes conflicting, positions on major issues, for example Suez, the Vietnam War, the Falklands, Grenada, Bosnia, the Arab/Israel dispute and, at times, Northern Ireland. Those differences did not fundamentally call into question the practice of close co-operation, to mutual advantage, on the overall relationship, including defence and intelligence.</p><p>The opposition of Germany and France to US policy in 2002 to 2003 does not appear to have had a lasting impact on the relationships of those countries with the US, despite the bitterness at the time.</p><p>However, a decision not to oppose does not have to be translated into unqualified support. Throughout the post-Second World War period (and, notably, during the wartime alliance), the UK's relationship with the US and the commonality of interests therein have proved strong enough to bear the weight of different approaches to international problems and not infrequent disagreements.</p><p>Had the UK stood by its differing position on Iraq – which was not an opposed position, but one in which the UK had identified conditions seen as vital by the UK Government – the Inquiry does not consider that this would have led to a fundamental or lasting change in the UK's relationship with the US.</p><p>This is a matter of judgement, and one on which Mr Blair, bearing the responsibility of leadership, took a different view.</p><p>The second reason for committing unqualified support was, by standing alongside and taking part in the planning, the UK would be able to influence US policy.</p><p>Mr Blair's stalwart support for the US after 9/11 had a significant impact in that country. Mr Blair developed a close working relationship with President Bush. He used this to compare notes and inject his views on the major issues of the day, and it is clear from the records of the discussions that President Bush encouraged that dialogue and listened to Mr Blair's opinions.</p><p>Mr Blair expressed his views in frequent telephone calls and in meetings with the President. There was also a very active channel between his Foreign Affairs Adviser and the President's National Security Advisor. Mr Blair also sent detailed written Notes to the President.</p><p>Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's Chief of Staff, told the Inquiry:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... the Prime Minister had a habit of writing notes, both internally and to President Clinton and to President Bush, on all sorts of subjects, because he found it better to put something in writing rather than to simply talk about it orally and get it much more concretely ... in focused terms."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-176" id="footnote-176-ref"><sup>176</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Mr Blair drew on information and briefing received from Whitehall departments, but evidently drafted many or most of his Notes to the President himself, showing the drafts to his close advisers in No.10 but not (ahead of despatch) to the relevant Cabinet Ministers.</p><p>How best to exercise influence with the President of the United States is a matter for the tactical judgement of the Prime Minister, and will vary between Prime Ministers and Presidents.

Second, they support the principle of collective responsibility by ensuring that, even though an important question may never reach the Cabinet itself, the decision will be fully considered and the final judgement will be sufficiently authoritative to ensure that the Government as a whole can properly be expected to accept responsibility for it."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-179" id="footnote-179-ref"><sup>179</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The Code also said:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"The business of the Cabinet and Ministerial Committees consists in the main of:</p><ol><li><p>questions which significantly engage the collective responsibility of the Government because they raise major issues of policy or because they are of critical importance to the public;</p></li><li><p>questions on which there is an unresolved argument between Departments."</p></li></ol><p></p></blockquote><p>Lord Wilson of Dinton told the Inquiry that between January 1998 and January 1999, in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 (see Section 1.1), as Cabinet Secretary, he had attended and noted 21 Ministerial discussions on Iraq: 10 in Cabinet, of which seven had <span class="quote">"some substance"</span>; five in DOP; and six ad hoc meetings, including one JIC briefing.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-180" id="footnote-180-ref"><sup>180</sup></a> Discussions in Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee would have been supported by the relevant part of the Cabinet Secretariat, the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec).</p><p>Similarly, Lord Wilson stated that, between 11 September 2001 and January 2002, the Government's response to international terrorism and the subsequent military action against the Taliban in Afghanistan had been managed through 46 Ministerial meetings.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-181" id="footnote-181-ref"><sup>181</sup></a></p><p>The last meeting of DOP on Iraq before the 2003 conflict, however, took place in March 1999.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-182" id="footnote-182-ref"><sup>182</sup></a></p><p>In April 2002, the MOD clearly expected consideration of military options to be addressed through DOP.

Some of those meetings were minuted; some were not.</p><p>As the guidance for the Cabinet Secretariat makes clear, the purpose of the minute of a meeting is to set out the conclusions reached so that those who have to take action know precisely what to do; the second purpose is to <span class="quote">"give the reasons why the conclusions were reached"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-184" id="footnote-184-ref"><sup>184</sup></a></p><p>Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from 2002 to 2005, described Mr Blair's characteristic way of working with his Cabinet colleagues as:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"… 'I like to move fast.

That was his sort of characteristic style, but it has drawbacks."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-185" id="footnote-185-ref"><sup>185</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Lord Turnbull subsequently told the Inquiry that the group described above was <span class="quote">"a professional forum ... they had ... with one possible exception [Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary], the right people in the room.

Unlike the full Cabinet, a Cabinet Committee has the right people present, including, for example, the military Chiefs of Staff or scientific advisers, its members are well briefed, it can take as long as it likes over its discussion on the basis of well-prepared papers, and it is independently chaired by a senior Minister with no departmental vested interest."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-189" id="footnote-189-ref"><sup>189</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The Inquiry concurs with this description of the function of a Cabinet Committee when it is working well. In particular, it recognises the important function which a Minister without departmental responsibilities for the issues under consideration can play. This can provide some external challenge from experienced members of the government and mitigate any tendency towards group-think. In the case of Iraq, for example, the inclusion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Deputy Prime Minister, as senior members of the Cabinet, or of Mr Cook, as a former Foreign Secretary known to have concerns about the policy, could have provided an element of challenge.</p><p>Mr Powell likewise recognises the importance of having written advice which can be seen before a meeting, allowing all those present to have shared information and the opportunity to digest it and seek further advice if necessary. This allows the time in meetings to be used productively.</p><p>The Inquiry considers that there should have been collective discussion by a Cabinet Committee or small group of Ministers on the basis of inter-departmental advice agreed at a senior level between officials at a number of decision points which had a major impact on the development of UK policy before the invasion of Iraq. Those were:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>The decision at the beginning of December 2001 to offer to work with President Bush on a strategy to deal with Iraq as part of Phase 2 of the <span class="quote">"War on Terror"</span>, despite the fact that there was no evidence of any Iraqi involvement with the attacks on the US or active links to Al Qaida.</p></li><li><p>The adoption of the position at the end of February 2002 that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with, together with the assumption that the only certain means to remove Saddam Hussein and his regime was to invade Iraq and impose a new government.</p></li><li><p>The position Mr Blair should adopt in discussions with President Bush at Crawford in April 2002. The meeting at Chequers on 2 April was given a presentation on the military options and did not explore the political and legal implications of a conflict with Iraq. There was no FCO representative at the Chequers meeting and no subsequent meeting with Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.</p></li><li><p>The position Mr Blair should adopt in his discussion with President Bush at Camp David on 5 and 6 September 2002. Mr Blair's long Note of 28 July, telling President Bush <span class="quote">"I will be with you, whatever"</span>, was seen, before it was sent, only by No.10 officials. A copy was sent afterwards to Mr Straw, but not to Mr Hoon. While the Note was marked <span class="quote">"Personal"</span> (to signal that it should have a restricted circulation), it represented an extensive statement of the UK Government's position by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States. The Foreign and Defence Secretaries should certainly have been given an opportunity to comment on the draft in advance.</p></li><li><p>A discussion in mid-September 2002 on the need for robust post-conflict planning.</p></li><li><p>The decision on 31 October 2002 to offer ground forces to the US for planning purposes.</p></li><li><p>The decision on 17 January 2003 to deploy large scale ground forces for operations in southern Iraq.</p></li><li><p>The position Mr Blair should adopt in his discussion with President Bush in Washington on 31 January 2003.</p></li><li><p>The proposals in Mr Blair's Note to President Bush of 19 February suggesting a deadline for a vote in the Security Council of 14 March.</p></li><li><p>A review of UK policy at the end of February 2003 when the inspectors had found no evidence of WMD and there was only limited support for the second resolution in the Security Council.</p></li><li><p>The question of whether Iraq had committed further material breaches as specified in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 1441 (2002), as posed in Mr Brummell's letter of 14 March to Mr Rycroft.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>In addition to providing a mechanism to probe and challenge the implications of proposals before decisions were taken, a Cabinet Committee or a more structured process might have identified some of the wider implications and risks associated with the deployment of military forces to Iraq. It might also have offered the opportunity to remedy some of the deficiencies in planning which are identified in Section 6 of the Report. There will, of course, be other policy issues which would benefit from the same approach.</p><p>Cabinet has a different role to that of a Cabinet Committee.</p><p>Mr Powell has written that:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... Cabinet is the right place to ratify decisions, the right place for people to raise concerns if they have not done so before, the right place for briefings by the Prime Minister and other Ministers on strategic issues, the right place to ensure political unity; but it is categorically not the right place for an informed decision on difficult and detailed policy issues."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-190" id="footnote-190-ref"><sup>190</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>In 2009, in a statement explaining a Cabinet decision to veto the release of minutes of one of its meetings under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, Mr Straw explained the need for frank discussion at Cabinet very cogently:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Serious and controversial decisions must be taken with free, frank – even blunt deliberations between colleagues. Dialogue must be fearless. Ministers must have the confidence to challenge each other in private. They must ensure that decisions have been properly thought through, sounding out all possibilities before committing themselves to a course of action. They must not feel inhibited from advancing options that may be unpopular or controversial. They must not be deflected from expressing dissent by the fear that they may be held personally to account for views that are later cast aside."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-191" id="footnote-191-ref"><sup>191</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry that:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... the discussion that we had in Cabinet was substantive discussion. We had it again and again and again, and the options were very simple. The options were: a sanctions framework that was effective; alternatively, the UN inspectors doing the job; alternatively, you have to remove Saddam. Those were the options."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-192" id="footnote-192-ref"><sup>192</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Mr Blair added:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Nobody in the Cabinet was unaware of ... what the whole issue was about.

Cabinet was certainly given updates on diplomatic developments and had opportunities to discuss the general issues. The number of occasions on which there was a substantive discussion of the policy was very much more limited.</p><p>There were substantive discussions of the policy on Iraq, although not necessarily of all the issues (as the Report sets out), in Cabinet on 7 March and 23 September 2002 and 16 January, 13 March and 17 March 2003. Those are the records which are being published with the Report.</p><p>At the Cabinet meeting on 7 March 2002, Mr Blair concluded:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... the concerns expressed in discussion were justified. It was important that the United States did not appear to be acting unilaterally. It was critically important to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. Any military action taken against President Saddam Hussein's regime had to be effective. On the other hand, the Iraqi regime was in clear breach of its obligations under several United Nations Security Council resolutions. Its WMD programmes posed a threat to peace. Iraq's neighbours regarded President Saddam Hussein as a danger. The right strategy was to engage closely with the Government of the United States in order to be in a position to shape policy and its presentation. The international community should proceed in a measured but determined way to decide how to respond to the real threat represented by the Iraqi regime. No decisions to launch military action had been taken and any action taken would be in accordance with international law. "The Cabinet, 'Took note, with approval.'"<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-194" id="footnote-194-ref"><sup>194</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Cabinet on 17 March 2003 noted Mr Blair's conclusion that <span class="quote">"the diplomatic process was at an end; Saddam Hussein would be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the House of Commons would be asked to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to enforce compliance, if necessary"</span>.</p><p>In Section 5 of the Report, the Inquiry concludes that Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which fully reflected the position on 17 March and explained the legal basis on which the UK could take military action and set out the risks of legal challenge.</p><p>There was no substantive discussion of the military options, despite promises by Mr Blair, before the meeting on 17 March.</p><p>In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Hoon wrote that by the time he joined Cabinet, in 1999:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... the pattern of the organisation and format of Cabinet meetings was ... well established. Tony Blair was well known to be extremely concerned about leaks from Cabinet discussions ... It was my perception that, largely as a consequence of this, he did not normally expect key decisions to be made in the course of Cabinet meetings. Papers were submitted to the Cabinet Office, and in turn by the Cabinet Office to appropriate Cabinet Committees for decisions."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-195" id="footnote-195-ref"><sup>195</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Mr Hoon wrote:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"At no time when I was serving in the Ministry of Defence were other Cabinet Ministers involved in discussions about the deployment of specific forces and the nature of their operations. Relevant details would have been circulated to 10 Downing Street or other Government departments as necessary ... I do not recall a single Cabinet level discussion of specific troop deployments and the nature of their operations."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-196" id="footnote-196-ref"><sup>196</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The Inquiry recognises that there will be operational constraints on discussion of the details of military deployments, but that would not preclude the discussion of the principles and the implications of military options.</p><p>In January 2006, the Cabinet discussed the proposal to deploy military forces to Helmand later that year.</p><p>The Inquiry also recognises that the nature of foreign policy, as the Report vividly demonstrates, requires the Prime Minister of the UK, the Foreign Secretary and their most senior officials to be involved in negotiating and agreeing policy on a day-by-day, and sometimes hour-by-hour basis.</p><p>It would neither be necessary nor feasible to seek a mandate from Cabinet at each stage of a discussion. That reinforces the importance of ensuring Cabinet is kept informed as strategy evolves, is given the opportunity to raise questions and is asked to endorse key decisions. Cabinet Ministers need more information than will be available from the media, especially on sensitive issues of foreign and security policy.</p><p>In 2009, three former Cabinet Secretaries<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-197" id="footnote-197-ref"><sup>197</sup></a> told the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... each of us, as Secretary of the Cabinet, has been constantly conscious of his responsibility to the Cabinet collectively and of the need to have regard to the needs and responsibilities of the other members of the Cabinet (and indeed of other Ministers) as well of those of the Prime Minister.

Now ... how does the Cabinet Secretary work? You come in and you are – even with the two roles that you have, head of an organisation of half a million civil servants and in some sense co-ordinating a public sector of about five million people. You have to make choices as to where you make your effort, and I think the policy I followed was not to take an issue over from someone to whom it was delegated simply because it was big and important, but you have to make a judgement as to whether it is being handled competently, whether that particular part is, in a sense, under pressure, whether you think they are getting it wrong in some sense, or they are missing certain important things."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-199" id="footnote-199-ref"><sup>199</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary to ensure that members of Cabinet are fully engaged in ways that allow them to accept collective responsibility and to meet their departmental obligations nevertheless remains.</p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2 id="advice-on-the-legal-basis-for-military-action">Advice on the legal basis for military action</h2><p>The Inquiry has reviewed the debate that took place within the Government and how it reached its decision.</p><p>The circumstances in which it was ultimately decided that there was a legal basis for UK participation were far from satisfactory.</p><p>It was not until 13 March 2003 that Lord Goldsmith advised that there was, on balance, a secure legal basis for military action.</p><p>In the letter of 14 March 2003 from Lord Goldsmith's office to No.10, which is addressed in Section 5 of the Report, Mr Blair was told that an essential ingredient of the legal basis was that he, himself, should be satisfied of the fact that Iraq was in breach of resolution 1441.</p><p>In accordance with that advice, it was Mr Blair who decided that, so far as the UK was concerned, Iraq was and remained in breach of resolution 1441.</p><p>Apart from No.10's response to the letter of 14 March, sent the following day, in terms that can only be described as perfunctory, no formal record was made of that decision and the precise grounds on which it was made remain unclear.</p><p>The Inquiry was told, and it accepts, that it would have been possible at that stage for the UK Government to have decided not to go ahead with military action if it had been necessary to make a decision to do so; or if the House of Commons on 18 March had voted against the Government.</p><p>Although, when resolution 1441 was adopted, there was unanimous support for a rigorous inspections and monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the means to disarm Iraq, there was no such consensus in the Security Council in March 2003.

Agreement to those resolutions indicated that doubts about whether Iraq had disarmed were widely shared.</p><p>In parallel, by 2000, the wider risk of proliferation was regarded as a major threat. There was heightened concern about:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>the danger of proliferation, particularly that countries of concern might obtain nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles; and</p></li><li><p>the potential risk that terrorist groups which were willing to use them might gain access to chemical and biological agents and, possibly, nuclear material, and the means to deliver them.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>These concerns were reinforced after 9/11.</p><p>The view conveyed in JIC Assessments between December 2000 and March 2002 was that, despite the considerable achievements of UNSCOM and the IAEA between 1991 and December 1998, including dismantling Iraq's nuclear programme, the inspectors had been unable to account for some of the ballistic missiles and chemical and biological weapons and material produced by Iraq; and that it had:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>not totally destroyed all its stockpile of chemical and biological weapons;</p></li><li><p>retained up to 360 tonnes of chemical agents and precursor chemicals and growth media which would allow it to produce more chemical and biological agents;</p></li><li><p>hidden a small number of long-range Al Hussein ballistic missiles; and</p></li><li><p>retained the knowledge, documentation and personnel which would allow it to reconstitute its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The JIC also judged that, since the departure of the weapons inspectors, Iraq:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>was actively pursuing programmes to extend the range of its existing short-range ballistic missiles beyond the permitted range of 150km;</p></li><li><p>had begun development of a ballistic missile with a range greater than 1,000km;</p></li><li><p>was capable of resuming undetected production of <span class="quote">"significant quantities"</span> of chemical and biological agents, and in the case of VX (a nerve agent) might have already done so; and</p></li><li><p>was pursuing activities that could be linked to a nuclear programme.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>Iraq's chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes were seen as a threat to international peace and security in the Middle East region, but Iraq was viewed as a less serious proliferation threat than other key countries of concern – Iran, Libya and North Korea – which had current nuclear programmes. Iraq's nuclear facilities had been dismantled by the weapons inspectors. The JIC judged that Iraq would be unable to obtain a nuclear weapon while sanctions remained effective.</p><p>The JIC continued to judge that co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida was <span class="quote">"unlikely"</span>, and that there was no <span class="quote">"credible evidence of Iraqi transfers of WMD-related technology and expertise to terrorist groups"</span>.</p><p>In mid-February 2002, in preparation for Mr Blair's planned meeting with President Bush in early April 2002, No.10 commissioned the preparation of a paper to inform the public about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and WMD more generally in four key countries of concern, North Korea, Iran, Libya and Iraq.</p><p>When the preparation of this document became public knowledge, it was perceived to be intended to underpin a decision on military action against Iraq. The content and timing became a sensitive issue.</p><p>Reflecting the UK position that action was needed to disarm Iraq, Mr Blair and Mr Straw began, from late February 2002, publicly to argue that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm or be disarmed in accordance with the obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of UN inspectors to Iraq.</p><p>The focus on Iraq was not the result of a step change in Iraq's capabilities or intentions.</p><p>When he saw the draft paper on WMD countries of concern on 8 March, Mr Straw commented:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Good, but should not Iraq be first and also have more text? The paper has to show why there is an exceptional threat from Iraq. It does not quite do this yet."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-200" id="footnote-200-ref"><sup>200</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>On 18 March, Mr Straw decided that a paper on Iraq should be issued before one addressing other countries of concern.</p><p>On 22 March, Mr Straw was advised that the evidence would not convince public opinion that there was an imminent threat from Iraq. Publication was postponed.</p><p>No.10 decided that the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat should co-ordinate the production of a <span class="quote">"public dossier"</span> on Iraq, and that Mr Campbell should <span class="quote">"retain the lead role on the timing/form of its release"</span>.</p><p>The statements prepared for, and used by, the UK Government in public, from late 2001 onwards, about Iraq's proscribed activities and the potential threat they posed were understandably written in more direct and less nuanced language than the JIC Assessments on which they drew.</p><p>The question is whether, in doing so, they conveyed more certainty and knowledge than was justified, or created tests it would be impossible for Iraq to meet. That is of particular concern in relation to the evidence in Section 4.1 on two key issues.</p><p>First, the estimates of the weapons and material related to Iraq's chemical and biological warfare programmes for which UNSCOM had been unable to account were based on extrapolations from UNSCOM records. Officials explicitly advised that it was <span class="quote">"inherently difficult to arrive at precise figures"</span>. In addition, it was acknowledged that neither UNSCOM nor the UK could be certain about either exactly what had existed or what Iraq had already destroyed.</p><p>The revised estimates announced by Mr Straw on 2 May were increasingly presented in Government statements as the benchmark against which Iraq should be judged.</p><p>Second, the expert MOD examination of issues in late March 2002 exposed the difficulties Iraq would have to overcome before it could acquire a nuclear weapon. That included the difficulty of acquiring suitable fissile material from the <span class="quote">"black market"</span>.</p><p>In addition, the tendency to refer in public statements only to Iraq's <span class="quote">"weapons of mass destruction"</span> without addressing their nature (the type of warhead and whether they were battlefield or strategic weapons systems) or how they might be used (as a last resort against invading military forces or as a weapon of terror to threaten civilian populations in other countries) was likely to have created the impression that Iraq posed a greater threat than the detailed JIC Assessments would have supported.</p><h3 id="iraq-wmd-assessments-july-to-september-2002">Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</h3><p>From late February 2002, the UK Government position was that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm in accordance with the obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of UN inspectors to Iraq.</p><p>The urgency and certainty with which the position was stated reflected both the ingrained beliefs already described and the wider context in which the policy was being discussed with the US.</p><p>But it also served to fuel the demand that the Government should publish the document it was known to have prepared, setting out the reasons why it was so concerned about Iraq.</p><p>In the spring and summer of 2002, senior officials and Ministers took the view that the Iraq dossier should not be published until the way ahead on the policy was clearer.</p><p>By late August 2002, the Government was troubled by intense speculation about whether a decision had already been taken to use military force. In Mr Blair's words, the US and UK had been <span class="quote">"outed"</span> as having taken a decision when no such decision had been taken.</p><p>Mr Blair's decision on 3 September to announce that the dossier would be published was a response to that pressure.</p><p>The dossier was designed to <span class="quote">"make the case"</span> and secure Parliamentary (and public) support for the Government's position that action was urgently required to secure Iraq's disarmament.</p><p>The UK Government intended the information and judgements in the Iraq dossier to be seen to be the product of the JIC in order to carry authority with Parliament and the public.</p><p>The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) was commissioned by No.10 on 5 September to examine whether it had any additional material which could be included.</p><p>Mr Scarlett, as Chairman of the JIC, was given the responsibility of producing the dossier.</p><p>The dossier drew on the 9 September JIC Assessment, 'Iraqi Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons – Possible Scenarios', which had been commissioned to address scenarios for Iraq's possible use of chemical and biological weapons in the event of military action, previous JIC Assessments and the subsequent report issued by SIS on 11 September.</p><p>The SIS report should have been shown to the relevant experts in the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) who could have advised their senior managers and the Assessments Staff.</p><p>Expert officials in DIS questioned the certainty with which some of the judgements in the dossier were expressed. Some of their questions were discussed during the preparation of the dossier. The text was agreed by Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence, at the JIC meeting on 19 September.</p><p>There is no evidence that other members of the JIC were aware at the time of the reservations recorded in the minute by Dr Brian Jones (the branch head of the nuclear, biological and chemical section in the Scientific and Technical Directorate of the Defence Intelligence Staff) of 19 September and that written by the chemical weapons expert in his team the following day.</p><p>The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 improperly influenced the text.</p><p>At issue are the judgements made by the JIC and how they and the intelligence were presented, including in Mr Blair's Foreword and in his statement to Parliament on 24 September 2002.</p><p>It is unlikely that Parliament and the public would have distinguished between the ownership and therefore the authority of the judgements in the Foreword and those in the Executive Summary and the main body of the dossier.</p><p>In the Foreword, Mr Blair stated that he believed the <span class="quote">"assessed intelligence"</span> had <span class="quote">"established beyond doubt"</span> that Saddam Hussein had <span class="quote">"continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that he had been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme"</span>. That raises two key questions.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Did Mr Blair's statements in whole or in part go further than the assessed intelligence?</p></li><li><p>Did that matter?</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The Inquiry is not questioning Mr Blair's belief, which he consistently reiterated in his evidence to the Inquiry, or his legitimate role in advocating Government policy.</p><p>But the deliberate selection of a formulation which grounded the statement in what Mr Blair believed, rather than in the judgements which the JIC had actually reached in its assessment of the intelligence, indicates a distinction between his beliefs and the JIC's actual judgements.</p><p>That is supported by the position taken by the JIC and No.10 officials at the time, and in the evidence offered to the Inquiry by some of those involved.</p><p>The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt that Saddam Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons. The Executive Summary of the dossier stated that the JIC judged that Iraq had <span class="quote">"continued to produce chemical and biological agents"</span>. The main text of the dossier said that there had been <span class="quote">"recent"</span> production. It also stated that Iraq had the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons. It did not say that Iraq had continued to produce weapons.</p><p>Nor had the assessed intelligence established beyond doubt that efforts to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC stated in the Executive Summary of the dossier that Iraq had:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>made covert attempts <span class="quote">"to acquire technology and materials which could be used in the production of nuclear weapons"</span>;</p></li><li><p><span class="quote">"sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having no active nuclear programme that would require it"</span>; and</p></li><li><p><span class="quote">"recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme"</span>.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>But the dossier made clear that, as long as sanctions remained effective, Iraq could not produce a nuclear weapon.</p><p>These conclusions draw on the evidence from the JIC Assessments at the time and the Executive Summary of the dossier, which are set out in Section 4.2. They do not rely on hindsight.</p><p>The JIC itself should have made that position clear because its ownership of the dossier, which was intended to inform a highly controversial policy debate, carried with it the responsibility to ensure that the JIC's integrity was protected.</p><p>The process of seeking the JIC's views, through Mr Scarlett, on the text of the Foreword shows that No.10 expected the JIC to raise any concerns it had.</p><p>The firmness of Mr Blair's beliefs, despite the underlying uncertainties, is important in considering how the judgements in the Foreword would have been interpreted by Cabinet in its discussions on 23 September and by Parliament.</p><p>In his statement to Parliament on 24 September and in his answers to subsequent questions, Mr Blair presented Iraq's past, current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction; and that, at some point in the future, that threat would become a reality.</p><p>By the time the dossier was published, President Bush had announced that the US was seeking action on Iraq through the UN, and Iraq had agreed to the return of inspectors.</p><p>Rather than the debate being framed in terms of the answers needed to the outstanding questions identified by UNSCOM and the IAEA, including the material for which UNSCOM had been unable to account, the dossier's description of Iraq's capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK Government measured Iraq's future statements and actions and the success of weapons inspections.</p><p>As Section 4.3 demonstrates, the judgements remained in place without challenge until the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Iraq's denials of the capabilities and intent attributed to it were not taken seriously.</p><p>As the flaws in the construct and the intelligence were exposed after the conflict, the dossier and subsequent statements to Parliament also became the baseline against which the Government's good faith and credibility were judged.</p><h3 id="iraq-wmd-assessments-october-2002-to-march-2003">Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</h3><p>From October 2002 onwards, the JIC focused on two main themes:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Iraq's attitude to the return of the inspectors and, from 8 November, its compliance with the specific obligations imposed by resolution 1441; and</p></li><li><p>Iraq's options, diplomatic and military, including the possible use of chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles against Coalition Forces or countries in the region in either pre-emptive attacks or in response to a military attack.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>In its Assessment of 18 December, the JIC made the judgements in the UK Government September dossier part of the test for Iraq.</p><p>The judgements about Iraq's capabilities and intentions relied heavily on Iraq's past behaviour being a reliable indicator of its current and future actions.</p><p>There was no consideration of whether, faced with the prospect of a US-led invasion, Saddam Hussein had taken a different position.</p><p>The absence of evidence of proscribed programmes and materials relating to the production or delivery of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons was attributed to Iraq's ability to conceal its activities and deceive the inspectors and the difficulties which it had been anticipated the inspectors would encounter.</p><p>The JIC Assessment of 11 October 2002 stated that a good intelligence flow from inside Iraq, supporting tougher inspections, would be <span class="quote">"central to success"</span>.</p><p>A key element of the Assessments was the reporting and intelligence on Iraq's intentions to conceal its activities, deceive the inspectors and obstruct the conduct of inspections, particularly Iraq's attitudes to preventing interviews with officials who were identified as associated with its proscribed programmes or who had been involved in Iraq's unilateral destruction of its weapons and facilities.</p><p>The large number of intelligence reports about Iraq's activities were interpreted from the perspective that Iraq's objectives were to conceal its programmes.</p><p>Similarly, Iraq's actions were consistently interpreted as indicative of deceit.</p><p>From early 2003, the Government drew heavily on the intelligence reporting of Iraq's activities to deceive and obstruct the inspectors to illustrate its conclusion that Iraq had no intention of complying with the obligations imposed in resolution 1441.</p><p>The Government also emphasised the reliability of the reporting.</p><p>The JIC's judgement from August 2002 until 19 March 2003 remained that Iraq might use chemical and biological weapons in response to a military attack.</p><p>Iraq's statements that it had no weapons or programmes were dismissed as further evidence of a strategy of denial.</p><p>In addition, the extent to which the JIC's judgements depended on inference and interpretation of Iraq's previous attitudes and behaviour was not recognised.</p><p>At no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might not have chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the policy community.</p><p>After its 9 September 2002 Assessment, the JIC was not asked to review its judgements on Iraq's capabilities and programmes which underpinned UK thinking. Nor did the JIC itself suggest such a review.</p><p>As a result there was no formal reassessment of the JIC judgements, and the 9 September Assessment and the 24 September dossier provided part of the baseline for the UK Government's view of Iraq's capabilities and intentions on its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</p><p>Given the weight which rested on the JIC's judgements about Iraq's possession of WMD and its future intent for the decision in March that military action should, if necessary, be taken to disarm Iraq, a formal reassessment of the JIC's judgements should have taken place.</p><p>This might have been prompted by Dr Blix's report to the Security Council on 14 February 2003, which demonstrated the developing divergence between the assessments presented by the US and UK. Dr Blix's report of 7 March, which changed the view that Iraqi behaviour was preventing UNMOVIC from carrying out its tasks, should certainly have prompted a review.</p><h3 id="the-search-for-wmd">The search for WMD</h3><p>Section 4.4 considers the impact of the failure to find stockpiles of WMD in Iraq in the months immediately after the invasion, and of the emerging conclusions of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), on:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>the Government's response to demands for an independent judge-led inquiry into pre-conflict intelligence on Iraq; and</p></li><li><p>the Government's public presentation of the nature of the threat from Saddam Hussein's regime and the decision to go to war.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The Inquiry has not sought to comment in detail on the specific conclusions of the ISC, FAC, Hutton and Butler Reports, all of which were published before the withdrawal by SIS in September 2004 of a significant proportion of the intelligence underpinning the JIC Assessments and September 2002 dossier on which UK policy had rested.</p><p>In addition to the conclusions of those reports, the Inquiry notes the forthright statement in March 2005 of the US Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction. Reporting to President Bush, the Commission stated that <span class="quote">"the [US] Intelligence Community was dead wrong in almost all of its pre-war judgments about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This was a major intelligence failure."</span></p><p>The evidence in Section 4.4 shows that, after the invasion, the UK Government, including the intelligence community, was reluctant to admit, and to recognise publicly, the mounting evidence that there had been failings in the UK's pre-conflict collection, validation, analysis and presentation of intelligence on Iraq's WMD.</p><p>Despite the failure to identify any evidence of WMD programmes during pre-conflict inspections, the UK Government remained confident that evidence would be found after the Iraqi regime had been removed.</p><p>Almost immediately after the start of the invasion, UK Ministers and officials sought to lower public expectations of immediate or significant finds of WMD in Iraq.</p><p>The lack of evidence to support pre-conflict claims about Iraq's WMD challenged the credibility of the Government and the intelligence community, and the legitimacy of the war.</p><p>The Government and the intelligence community were both concerned about the consequences of the presentational aspects of their pre-war assessments being discredited.</p><p>By June, the Government had acknowledged the need for a review of the UK's pre-conflict intelligence on Iraq. It responded to demands for an independent, judge-led inquiry by expressing support for the reviews initiated by the ISC and the FAC.</p><p>The announcement of the Hutton Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly on 18 July, reinforced the Government's position that additional reviews were not needed.</p><p>The Government maintained that position until January 2004, backed by three votes in the House of Commons (on 4 June, 15 July and 22 October 2003) rejecting a succession of Opposition motions calling for an independent inquiry into the use of pre-war intelligence.</p><p>Mr Blair's initial response to growing criticism of the failure to find WMD was to counsel patience.</p><p>After the publication of the ISG Interim Report, the Government's focus shifted from finding stockpiles of weapons to emphasising evidence of the Iraqi regime's strategic intent.</p><p>Once President Bush made clear his decision to set up an independent inquiry, Mr Blair's resistance to a public inquiry became untenable.</p><p>After the announcement of the Butler Review, the UK Government's focus shifted to the content of the next ISG report, the Status Report.</p><p>The Government, still concerned about the nature of the public debate on WMD in the UK, sought to ensure that the Status Report included existing ISG material highlighting the strategic intentions of Saddam Hussein's regime and breaches of Security Council resolutions.</p><p>Mr Blair remained concerned about continuing public and Parliamentary criticism of the pre-conflict intelligence, the failure to find WMD and the decision to invade Iraq. After the reports from the Hutton Inquiry, the ISG and the US Commission, he sought to demonstrate that, although <span class="quote">"the exact basis for action was not as we thought"</span>, the invasion had still been justified.</p><p>The ISG's findings were significant, but did not support past statements by the UK and US Governments, which had focused on Iraq's current capabilities and an urgent and growing threat.</p><p>The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 was not the one given before the conflict.</p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2 id="planning-for-a-postsaddam-hussein-iraq">Planning for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq</h2><h3 id="the-failure-to-plan-or-prepare-for-known-risks">The failure to plan or prepare for known risks</h3><p>The information on Iraq available to the UK Government before the invasion provided a clear indication of the potential scale of the post-conflict task.</p><p>It showed that, in order to achieve the UK's desired end state, any post-conflict administration would need to:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>restore infrastructure that had deteriorated significantly in the decade since 1991, to the point where it was not capable of meeting the needs of the Iraqi people;</p></li><li><p>administer a state where the upper echelons of a regime that had been in power since 1968 had been abruptly removed and in which the capabilities of the wider civil administration, many of whose employees were members of the ruling party, were difficult to assess; and</p></li><li><p>provide security in a country faced with a number of potential threats, including: - internecine violence;</p></li><li><p>terrorism; and</p></li><li><p>Iranian interference.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>In December 2002, the MOD described the post-conflict phase of operations as <span class="quote">"strategically decisive"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-201" id="footnote-201-ref"><sup>201</sup></a> But when the invasion began, the UK Government was not in a position to conclude that satisfactory plans had been drawn up and preparations made to meet known post-conflict challenges and risks in Iraq and to mitigate the risk of strategic failure.</p><p>Throughout the planning process, the UK assumed that the US would be responsible for preparing the post-conflict plan, that post-conflict activity would be authorised by the UN Security Council, that agreement would be reached on a significant post-conflict role for the UN and that international partners would step forward to share the post-conflict burden.</p><p>On that basis, the UK planned to reduce its military contribution in Iraq to medium scale within four months of the start of the invasion<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-202" id="footnote-202-ref"><sup>202</sup></a> and expected not to have to make a substantial commitment to post-conflict administration.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-203" id="footnote-203-ref"><sup>203</sup></a></p><p>Achieving that outcome depended on the UK's ability to persuade the US of the merits of a significant post-conflict role for the UN.</p><p>The UK could not be certain at any stage in the year before the invasion that it would succeed in that aim.</p><p>In January 2003, the UK sought to persuade the US of the benefits of UN leadership of Iraq's interim post-conflict civil administration.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-204" id="footnote-204-ref"><sup>204</sup></a> Officials warned that, <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/213983/2003-03-19-minute-straw-and-hoon-to-prime-minister-iraq-uk-military-contribution-to-post-conflict-iraq.pdf">to post-conflict Iraq'.</a> if the UK failed to persuade the US, it risked <span class="quote">"being drawn into a huge commitment of UK resources for a highly complex task of administration and law and order for an uncertain period"</span>.</p><p>By March 2003, having failed to persuade the US of the advantages of a UN-led interim administration, the UK had set the less ambitious goal of persuading the US to accept UN authorisation of a Coalition-led interim administration and an international presence that would include the UN.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-205" id="footnote-205-ref"><sup>205</sup></a></p><p>On 19 March, Mr Blair stated in Parliament that discussions were taking place with the US, UN and others on the role of the UN and post-conflict issues.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-206" id="footnote-206-ref"><sup>206</sup></a></p><p>Discussions continued, but, as the invasion began:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>The UK had not secured US agreement to a Security Council resolution authorising post-conflict administration and could not be sure when, or on what terms, agreement would be possible.</p></li><li><p>The extent of the UN's preparations, which had been hindered by the absence of agreement on post-conflict arrangements, remained uncertain.

Once the city was under its control, the UK was responsible, as the Occupying Power, for maintenance of law and order. Within its predominantly Shia Area of Operations, the UK assumed that risks to Coalition Forces would be lower than in the so-called <span class="quote">"Sunni triangle"</span> controlled by the US.</p><p>Before the invasion, the JIC and the DIS had each identified that there was a risk of lawlessness breaking out in Iraq, and that it would be important to deal with it swiftly. Others, including Mr Blair, Sir Kevin Tebbit and the Iraq Policy Unit, had recognised the seriousness of that risk.</p><p>However, the formal authorisation for action in Iraq issued by Adm Boyce on 18 March contained no instruction on how to establish a safe and secure environment if lawlessness broke out as anticipated. Although it was known that Phase IV would begin quickly, no Rules of Engagement for that phase, including for dealing with lawlessness, were created and promulgated before UK troops entered the country.</p><p>Both before and during the invasion Lt Gen Reith made the absence of instructions to UK forces covering what to do if faced with lawless behaviour by the Iraqi population in Basra explicit to the Chiefs of Staff.</p><p>Faced with widespread looting after the invasion, and without instructions, UK commanders had to make their own judgements about what to do. Brigadier Graham Binns, commanding the 7 Armoured Brigade which had taken Basra City, told the Inquiry that he had concluded that <span class="quote">"the best way to stop looting was just to get to a point where there was nothing left to loot"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-229" id="footnote-229-ref"><sup>229</sup></a></p><p>Although the implementation of tactical plans to deal with lawlessness was properly the responsibility of in-theatre commanders, it was the responsibility of the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chief of Joint Operations to ensure that appropriate Rules of Engagement were set, and preparations made, to equip commanders on the ground to deal with it effectively. They should have ensured that those steps were taken.</p><p>The impact of looting was felt primarily by the Iraqi population rather than by Coalition Forces.

The looting of ministry buildings and damage to state-owned infrastructure in particular added to the challenges of the Occupation.</p><p>Reflecting in June 2004, Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Iraq from March to June 2004, judged that the failure to crack down on looting in Baghdad in April 2003 released <span class="quote">"a crime wave which the Coalition has never been able to bring fully under control"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-233" id="footnote-233-ref"><sup>233</sup></a></p><p>After visiting Iraq in early May 2003, General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, observed:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"A security vacuum still exists [in Baghdad] ... particularly at night.

The Chiefs of Staff did not conclude that the tasks it was proposed that 16 Air Assault Brigade should undertake were unnecessary, but rather that US troops would complete them.</p><p></p><h3>UK Influence On Post-Invasion Strategy: Resolution 1483</h3><p></p><p>On 21 March 2003, the day after the start of the invasion, Mr Powell and Sir David Manning, two of Mr Blair's closest advisers, offered him advice on how to influence the post-invasion US agenda. Key among their concerns was the need for post-conflict administrative arrangements to have the legitimacy conferred by UN endorsement. Such UK plans for the post-conflict period as had been developed relied on the deployment of an international reconstruction effort to Iraq. Controversy surrounding the launch of the invasion made that challenging to deliver; the absence of UN endorsement would make it close to impossible.</p><p>Discussion between the US and UK on the content of a new UN Security Council resolution began the same day. Resolution 1483 (2003) was eventually adopted on 22 May.</p><p>US and UK objectives for the resolution were different, and in several substantive respects the text of resolution 1483 differed from the UK's preferred position.</p><p>The UK wanted oil revenues to be controlled by an Iraqi body, or failing that by the UN or World Bank, in line with the pre-invasion promise to use them exclusively for the benefit of Iraq. Instead, resolution 1483 placed the power to spend the Development Fund for Iraq into the hands of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), overseen by a monitoring board. That was in line with US objectives, but did not address UK concerns.</p><p>The UK considered that an Interim Iraqi Administration should have real powers, and not be subordinate to the CPA. Resolution 1483 said that the CPA would retain its responsibilities until an internationally recognised representative government was established. The text did not go so far as to require an interim administration to report formally to the CPA, as the US wished, but that was in effect how the relationship between the CPA and the Governing Council established by resolution 1483 operated.</p><p>The UK's policy position was that the UN should take the lead in establishing the Interim Iraqi Administration. Resolution 1483 gave the UN a role working with the people of Iraq and the CPA, but did not give it the lead. Evidence considered by the Inquiry suggests that there was consistent reluctance on the part of the UN to take on such a role and the UK position was therefore not wholly realistic.</p><p>Resolution 1483 formally designated the UK and US as joint Occupying Powers in Iraq. It also set the conditions for the CPA's dominance over post-invasion strategy and policy by handing it control of funding for reconstruction and influence on political development at least equal to that of the UN.</p><p></p><h3>UK Influence On The Coalition Provisional Authority</h3><p></p><p>By the time resolution 1483 was adopted, the CPA was already operating in Iraq under the leadership of Ambassador L Paul Bremer, reporting to Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary. There was no reporting line from the CPA to the UK.</p><p>The resolution's designation of the US and UK as joint Occupying Powers did not reflect the reality of the Occupation. The UK contribution to the CPA's effort was much smaller than that of the US and was particularly concerned with Basra.</p><p>The UK took an early decision to concentrate its effort in one geographical area rather than accept a national lead for a particular element of the Coalition effort (such as police reform). However, it was inevitable that Iraq's future would be determined in Baghdad, as both the administrative centre and the place where the power shift from minority Sunni rule to majority Shia rule was going to be most keenly felt. Having decided to concentrate its effort on an area some distance removed from the capital, the UK's ability to influence policy under debate in Baghdad was curtailed.</p><p>In Baghdad itself, the UK provided only a small proportion of the staff for the military and civilian headquarters. The low numbers were influenced in part by reasonable concerns about the personal legal liabilities of UK staff working initially in ORHA and then in the CPA, and what their deployment might imply about the UK's responsibility for decisions made by those organisations, in the absence of formal consultation or the right of veto.</p><p>The pre-invasion focus on a leading UN role in Iraq meant that little thought had been given to the status of UK personnel during an occupation which followed an invasion without Security Council authorisation. Better planning, including proper assessment of a variety of different possible scenarios, would have allowed such issues to be worked through at a much earlier stage.</p><p>There was an urgent need for suitably experienced UK officials ready to deploy to Baghdad, but they had not been identified (see Section 15).</p><p>No governance arrangements were designed before the invasion which might have enabled officials and Ministers based in London and Washington to manage the implications of a joint occupation involving separate resources of a very different scale. Such arrangements would have provided a means to identify and resolve different perspectives on policy, and to facilitate joint decisions.</p><p>Once the CPA had been established, policy decisions were made largely in Baghdad, where there was also no formal US/UK governance structure. This created a risk described to the Inquiry by Sir Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser from 2001 to 2006, as <span class="quote">"the UK being held jointly responsible for acts or omissions of the CPA, without a right to consult and a right of joint decision"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-235" id="footnote-235-ref"><sup>235</sup></a></p><p>To manage that risk, the UK proposed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the US to establish procedures for working together on issues related to the Occupation, but it could not be agreed. Having supplied the overwhelming majority of the CPA's resources, the US had little incentive to give the UK an influential role in deciding how those resources were to be used, and the UK lacked the will and leverage to insist.</p><p>In the absence of formal arrangements, there was a clear risk that the UK would be inadequately involved in important decisions, and the UK struggled from the start to have a significant effect on the CPA's policies. This was a source of concern to both Ministers and officials in 2003, but the issue was never resolved.</p><p>Senior individuals deployed to Iraq by the UK at this time saw themselves either as working for the CPA in support of its objectives and as part of its chain of command, or as UK representatives within the CPA with a remit to seek to influence CPA decisions. No-one formally represented the UK position within the CPA decision-making process, a serious weakness which should have been addressed at an early stage.</p><p>Managing a joint occupation of such size and complexity effectively and coherently required regular formal and informal discussion and clear decision-making at all levels, both between capitals and in-country. Once attempts to agree an MOU had failed, the chances of constructing such mechanisms were slim.</p><p>In the absence of an MOU with the US, the UK's influence in Baghdad depended heavily on the personal impact of successive Special Representatives and British Ambassadors to Iraq and the relationships they were able to build with senior US figures.</p><p>Some instances of important CPA decisions in which the UK played little or no formal part were:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>The decision to issue CPA Order No.2, which <span class="quote">"dissolved"</span> (or disbanded) a number of military and other security entities that had operated as part of Saddam Hussein's regime, including the armed forces (see Section 12). This was raised informally by Ambassador Bremer in his first meeting with Mr John Sawers, Mr Blair's Special Representative on Iraq, who – unbriefed – did not at that point take a contrary position. The concept of creating a new army had also been raised by Mr Walt Slocombe, CPA Senior Adviser on National Security and Defense, in discussion with Mr Hoon. Dissolution was a key decision which was to have a significant effect on the alienation of the Sunni community and the development of an insurgency in Iraq, and the terms and timing of this important Order should have been approved by both Washington and London.</p></li><li><p>Decisions on how to spend the Development Fund for Iraq, which resolution 1483 gave the CPA the power to make. CPA Regulation No.2 subsequently vested Ambassador Bremer with control of the Fund, effectively placing it under US control. This exacerbated concerns about the under-resourcing of CPA(South) as expressed in Mr Straw's letter to Mr Blair of 5 June 2003 (see Section 10.1).</p></li><li><p>The creation of the Iraqi Central Bank as an independent body in July 2003 (see Sections 9.2 and 10.1). This came as a surprise to the UK despite the close involvement of officials from the Treasury in arrangements for Iraq's new currency and budget.</p></li><li><p>The creation of a new Iraqi Central Criminal Court (see Section 9.2), the announcement of which UK officials could not delay for long enough to enable the Attorney General to give his view on its legality under the terms of resolution 1483.</p></li><li><p>Production of the CPA's 'Vision for Iraq' and 'Achieving the Vision' <em>(</em>see Sections 9.2 and 10.1<em>).</em>Mr Sawers alerted the FCO to the first document on<em></em>6 July when it was already at an advanced stage of drafting, and by 18 July it had been signed off by the Pentagon. No formal UK approval was sought for a document which was intended to provide strategic direction to the Coalition's non-military effort in Iraq.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>UK involvement in CPA decisions about the scope and implementation of de-Ba'athification policy is considered in Section 11.2.</p><p>In some areas, the UK was able to affect CPA policy through the influence that Mr Sawers or his successor Sir Jeremy Greenstock exerted on senior US officials. Both used their diplomatic experience to build connections with Iraqi politicians and contribute to the political development of Iraq. Instances of UK influence included:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Mr Sawers' involvement in the plans for an Interim Iraqi Administration, in respect of which he considered that <span class="quote">"much of the thinking is ours"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-236" id="footnote-236-ref"><sup>236</sup></a></p></li><li><p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock's <span class="quote">"two chickens, two eggs"</span> plan, which overcame political stalemate between the CPA and Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani on how the new Iraqi Constitution should be created. The plan led to the 15 November Agreement which set the timetable for transfer of sovereignty to a transitional administration by 30 June 2004.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that negotiations on the content of the Transitional Administrative Law reached a successful conclusion. Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that he had prevented the Kurdish delegation from leaving, <span class="quote">"which Bremer wasn't aware of"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-237" id="footnote-237-ref"><sup>237</sup></a></p></li><li><p>The level of female representation in Iraq's new political structures, including the 25 percent <span class="quote">"goal"</span> for members of the National Assembly set by the Transitional Administrative Law, which the UK pursued with some success.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>In the absence of decision-making arrangements in which the UK had a formal role, too much reliance was placed on communication between Mr Blair and President Bush, one of the very small number of ways of influencing US policy. Some issues were addressed by this route: for instance, using his regular conversations with President Bush, Mr Blair was able, with some success, to urge caution in relation to the US operation in Fallujah in April 2004.</p><p>But the channel of communication between Prime Minister and President should be reserved for the most strategic and most intractable issues. It is not the right mechanism for day-to-day policy-making or an effective way of making tactical decisions.</p><p>It is impossible to say whether a greater and more formal UK input to CPA decisions would have led to better outcomes. But it is clear that the UK's ability to influence decisions made by the CPA was not commensurate with its responsibilities as joint Occupying Power.</p><p></p><h3>A Decline In Security</h3><p></p><p>From early June 2003, and throughout the summer, there were signs that security in both Baghdad and the South was deteriorating. The MOD's SPG warned that <span class="quote">"more organised opposition to the Coalition may be emerging"</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-238" id="footnote-238-ref"><sup>238</sup></a> as discontent about the Coalition's failure to deliver a secure environment began to grow in the Iraqi population.</p><p>The extent of the decline in Baghdad and central Iraq overshadowed the decline in Multi-National Division (South-East) (MND(SE)). Food shortages and the failure of essential services such as the supply of electricity and water, plus lack of progress in the political process, however, began to erode the relationship between UK forces and the local population. The deterioration was exemplified by attacks on UK forces in Majar al-Kabir in Maysan province on 22 and 24 June.</p><p>As the summer wore on, authoritative sources in the UK, such as the JIC, began to identify issues with the potential to escalate into conflict and to recognise the likelihood that extremist groups would become more co-ordinated. The constraint imposed on reconstruction activities by the lack of security began to be apparent. Mr Sawers and Sir David Manning expressed concern about whether the UK had sufficient troops deployed in MND(SE), and about the permeability of Maysan's substantial border with Iran.</p><p>From early July, security was seen in Whitehall as the key concern and was raised by Mr Blair with President Bush.</p><p>A circular analysis began to develop, in which progress on reconstruction required security to be improved, and improved security required the consent generated by reconstruction activity. Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), reported <span class="quote">"a decline in Iraqi consent to the Coalition in MND(SE) due to the failure by the Coalition to deliver improvements in essential services"</span> and that Shia leaders were warning of a short grace period before further significant deterioration.</p><p>By the autumn of 2003, violence was escalating in Baghdad and attacks were becoming more sophisticated. Attacks on the UN in August and September, which injured and killed a number of UN officials including the UN Special Representative for Iraq, prompted some organisations to withdraw their international staff. Although Basra was less turbulent than the capital, the risk of a ripple effect from Baghdad – as identified by Gen Jackson in May – remained.</p><p>The JIC assessed on 3 September that the security environment would probably worsen over the year ahead. There had been a number of serious attacks on the Coalition in MND(SE), and Islamic <span class="quote">"extremists/terrorists"</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-239" id="footnote-239-ref"><sup>239</sup></a> were expected to remain a long-term threat in Iraq. The UK's military and civilian representatives on the ground were reporting a growing insurgency in central Iraq.</p><p>Despite that evidence, military planning under the leadership of General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, proceeded on the basis that the situation in Basra would remain relatively benign.</p><p>The Inquiry considers that a deterioration in security could and should have been identified by Lt Gen Reith by the end of August 2003 and that the cumulative evidence of a deteriorating security situation should have led him to conclude that the underlying assumptions on which the UK's Iraq campaign was based was over-optimistic, and to instigate a review of the scale of the UK's military effort in Iraq.</p><p>There were a number of issues that might have been examined by such a review, including:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>whether the UK had sufficient resources in MND(SE) to deal with a worsening security situation; and</p></li><li><p>whether the UK should engage outside MND(SE) in the interests of Iraq's overall stability (as had been advocated by Gen Jackson, Maj Gen Richards and Lt Gen Pigott).</p></li></ul><p></p><p>No such review took place.</p><p>There was a strong case for reinforcing MND(SE) so that it could handle its high-priority tasks (providing essential security for reconstruction projects, protecting existing infrastructure, guarding key sites and improving border security to inhibit the import of arms from Iran) effectively in changing circumstances. Those tasks all demanded a higher level of manpower than was available. Although additional military personnel were deployed in September 2003, mainly to fill existing gaps in support for reconstruction activities, their numbers were far too small to have a significant impact.</p><p>The failure to consider the option of reinforcement at this time was a serious omission and Lt Gen Reith and Gen Walker should have ensured that UK force levels in MND(SE) were formally reconsidered in autumn 2003 or at the latest by the end of the year. Increases in UK force levels in order to address the security situation should have been recommended to Ministers. Any opportunity to regain the initiative and pre-empt further deterioration in the security situation was lost.</p><p>In October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, Commander Combined Joint Task Force-7, had <span class="quote">"come to recognise that Coalition operations are at a standstill and that there is a need to regain momentum"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-240" id="footnote-240-ref"><sup>240</sup></a> Doubts started to build about the chances of credible elections based on a legitimate constitution in the course of 2004 and work began to look for alternatives to the plan set out by Ambassador Bremer. The <span class="quote">"bloodiest 48-hour period in Baghdad since March"</span>,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-241" id="footnote-241-ref"><sup>241</sup></a> including an attack on the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad's Green Zone, was sufficient to convince some that a pivotal point in the security situation had been reached.</p><p>When President Bush visited London in November, Mr Blair provided him with a paper written by Sir Jeremy Greenstock which argued that security should be the highest priority in the run-up to June 2004, when the Iraqi Transitional Government would take power. Sir Jeremy suggested that troop levels should be looked at again and highlighted <span class="quote">"the dangers we face if we do not get a grip on the security situation"</span> as a topic that President Bush and Mr Blair needed to discuss in stark terms.</p><p>The constraints within which the UK was operating as a result of the limited scale of forces deployed in Iraq were articulated clearly for the Chiefs of Staff in December. Lt Gen Fry argued that a strategy of <span class="quote">"early effect"</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-242" id="footnote-242-ref"><sup>242</sup></a> was needed which prioritised campaign success. Operation TELIC was the UK <span class="quote">"Main Effort"</span>, but deploying additional resources in a way that was compliant with the Defence Planning Assumptions would require the withdrawal of resources from other operations.</p><p>On 1 January 2004, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote bluntly: <span class="quote">"This theatre remains a security crisis."</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-243" id="footnote-243-ref"><sup>243</sup></a></p><p>Despite mounting evidence of violent insurgency, the UK's policy of military drawdown in Iraq continued. After force levels had been reviewed in January, the rationale for continued drawdown was based on adjusted criteria by which the success of Security Sector Reform would be judged, meaning that such reform would be implemented <span class="quote">"only to applicable standards for Iraq"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-244" id="footnote-244-ref"><sup>244</sup></a></p><p></p><h3>The Turning Point</h3><p></p><p>February 2004 was the worst month for Coalition casualties since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. More than 200 people, mainly Iraqi citizens, were killed in suicide attacks. Attacks on the Iraqi Security Forces were increasing and concerns about Islamic extremists operating in Iraq began to grow. By the end of March, more than 200 attacks targeting Iraqi citizens were being reported each week.</p><p>In April, there was a sudden escalation in attacks by the Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) in Basra, described by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE) as <span class="quote">"like a switch had been flicked"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-245" id="footnote-245-ref"><sup>245</sup></a> In Fallujah, a US offensive which followed the ambush and murder of four security contractors provoked an angry response from the Sunni community.</p><p>The significant worsening of security, coupled with revelations of abuse by members of the US military of Iraqi detainees held in Abu Ghraib prison, led many of the Inquiry's witnesses to conclude that the spring of 2004 had been a turning point.</p><p>At the end of April, Mr Blair's analysis was that the key issue in Iraq was not multi-faceted, rather it was <span class="quote">"simple: security"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-246" id="footnote-246-ref"><sup>246</sup></a></p><p>Despite the failing security situation in MND(SE) in spring 2004, Gen Walker was explicit that no additional troops were required for the tasks currently assigned to the UK.</p><p>The Chiefs of Staff maintained the view they had originally reached in November 2003, that HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) should not be actively considered for deployment to Iraq, even though:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Iraq was a higher priority for the UK than Afghanistan;</p></li><li><p>security in Iraq was clearly worsening and had been identified by Mr Blair as the key issue; and</p></li><li><p>there had been a specific US request for deployment of HQ ARRC.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 id="transition">Transition</h3><p></p><h3>UK Influence On US Strategy Post-CPA</h3><p></p><p>In June 2004, the US and UK ceased to be Occupying Powers in Iraq and the CPA was disbanded. Responsibility for day-to-day interaction on civil affairs with the Iraqi Interim Government on civil affairs passed to the newly appointed British and US Ambassadors.</p><p>After the handover, the UK's priorities were to maintain the momentum of the political process towards elections in January 2005, and to ensure that the conditions for the drawdown of its forces were achieved.</p><p>Mr Blair and President Bush continued to discuss Iraq on a regular basis. It continued to be the case that relatively small issues were raised to this level. The UK took false comfort that it was involved in US decision-making from the strength of that relationship.</p><p>Themes which Mr Blair emphasised to President Bush included the acceleration of Security Sector Reform and the Iraqiisation of security, UN engagement, better outreach to the Sunni community (often referred to as <span class="quote">"reconciliation"</span>), provision of direct support to Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and better use of local media to transmit a positive message about the coalition's intentions and actions.</p><p></p><h3>Planning For Withdrawal</h3><p></p><p>By July 2004, the UK envisaged that, providing the necessary criteria were met, there would be a gradual reduction in troop numbers during 2005 leading to final withdrawal in 2006, to be followed by a period of <span class="quote">"Strategic Overwatch"</span>.</p><p>The most important of the criteria that would enable coalition troops to withdraw was the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the lead on security (Iraqiisation). Having recognised that a stable and secure environment was the key factor on which progress in Iraq depended, by May 2004 the UK solution was <span class="quote">"a better and quicker plan for building Iraqi capacity in the Police, Civil Defence Corps, the Army and the Intelligence Service"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-247" id="footnote-247-ref"><sup>247</sup></a> This made sense in the long term but was unlikely to meet the requirement to regain control of Iraq rapidly in the face of a mounting insurgency. Reform of the Iraqi Security Forces is addressed in detail in Section 12.</p><p>By mid-August, the level of attacks against coalition forces had matched the previous peak in April of the same year. In September, Lieutenant General John McColl (Senior British Military Representative – Iraq) judged that the Iraqi Security Forces would not be able to take full responsibility for security before 2006.</p><p>In September 2004, Gen Walker received a well-argued piece of advice from Lt Gen McColl which made clear that the conditions on which decisions on drawdown were to be based were unlikely to be met in the near future. Despite the warnings in Lt Gen McColl's paper and his advice that <span class="quote">"the time is right for the consideration of the substantive issues"</span>,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-248" id="footnote-248-ref"><sup>248</sup></a> the Chiefs of Staff, chaired by Gen Walker, declined to engage in a substantive review of UK options.</p><p>The Inquiry recognises that the scale of the resources which the UK might have deployed to deal with the issues was substantially less than the US could bring to bear. It is possible that the UK may not have been able to make a real difference, when the key strategic change that might have affected the outcome was the deployment of a much larger force. But proper consideration ought to have been given to what options were available, including for the deployment of additional personnel. Mr Straw raised the need for such a debate with Mr Blair in October.</p><p>The UK had consistently resisted US requests to deploy additional personnel, which Lt Gen McColl described as having <span class="quote">"chipped away at the US/UK relationship"</span>,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-249" id="footnote-249-ref"><sup>249</sup></a> but in October it was agreed that the Black Watch would be deployed to North Babil for 30 days to backfill US forces needed for operations in Fallujah. Approximately 350 personnel from 1st Battalion, the Royal Highland Fusiliers were also deployed to Iraq to provide additional security across MND(SE) during the election period in January and February 2005. The UK remained reluctant to commit any further forces in the longer term: when Dutch forces withdrew from Muthanna province, the UK instead redeployed forces from elsewhere in MND(SE) plus a small amount of additional logistic support.</p><p>In January 2005, Lt Gen Fry produced a thoughtful and realistic assessment of the prospects for security in Iraq, observing that <span class="quote">"we are not on track to deliver the Steady State Criteria (SSC) before the UN mandate expires, or even shortly thereafter"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-250" id="footnote-250-ref"><sup>250</sup></a> He judged that <span class="quote">"only additional military effort by the MNF-I [Multi-National Force – Iraq] as a whole"</span> might be able to get the campaign back on track. Lt Gen Fry identified three possible courses of action for the UK: increasing the UK scale of effort, maintaining the status quo or, if it were judged that the campaign was irretrievable, accepting failure and seeking to mitigate UK liability.</p><p>The Inquiry endorses Lt Gen Fry's assessment of the options open to the UK at this point and considers that full and proper consideration should have been given to each option by DOP.</p><p>In his advice to Mr Blair on 21 January, Gen Walker did not expose the assessment made by Lt Gen Fry that only additional military effort by the MNF-I might be able to get the campaign back on track.</p><p>On 30 January, elections for the Transitional National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies took place across Iraq. Security arrangements involved 130,000 personnel from the Iraqi Security Forces, supported by 184,500 troops from the MNF-I. The JIC assessed that perhaps fewer than 10 percent of voters had turned out in the Sunni heartlands and judged that <span class="quote">"without Sunni engagement in the political process, it will not be possible significantly to undermine the insurgency"</span>.</p><p>In April, the JIC assessed that:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"A significant Sunni insurgency will continue through 2005 and beyond, but the opportunities for reducing it appear greater than we judged in early February."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-251" id="footnote-251-ref"><sup>251</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p></p><h3>The Impact Of Afghanistan</h3><p></p><p>In June 2004, the UK had made a public commitment to deploy HQ ARRC to Afghanistan in 2006, based on a recommendation from the Chiefs of Staff and Mr Hoon, and with Mr Straw's support. HQ ARRC was a NATO asset for which the UK was the lead nation and provided 60 percent of its staff.</p><p>It appears that senior members of the Armed Forces reached the view, throughout 2004 and 2005, that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that it would make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it might have greater effect.</p><p>In February 2005, the UK announced that it would switch its existing military effort in Afghanistan from the north to Helmand province in the south.</p><p>In 2002, <em>A New Chapter</em>, an MOD review of the 1998 <em>Strategic Defence Review</em> (SDR), had reaffirmed that the UK's Armed Forces would be unable to support two enduring medium scale military operations at the same time:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Since the SDR we have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either a single major operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the Gulf War in 1990-91), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as in the mid-1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial deployment ... if this were made necessary by a second crisis. We would not, however, expect both deployments to involve war-fighting or to maintain them simultaneously for longer than six months."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-252" id="footnote-252-ref"><sup>252</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>As described in Section 16.1, since 2002 the Armed Forces had been consistently operating at or above the level of concurrency defined in the 1998 SDR, and the continuation of Op TELIC had placed additional strain on military personnel.</p><p>By May 2005, the UK had been supporting an operation of at least medium scale in Iraq for more than two years. The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy Sub-Committee on Iraq (DOP(I)) recognised that future force levels in Iraq would need to be considered in the context of the requirement to achieve <span class="quote">"strategic balance"</span> with commitments in Afghanistan, to ensure that both were properly resourced.</p><p>In July 2005, DOP agreed proposals for both the transfer of the four provinces in MND(SE) to Iraqi control and for the deployment of the UK Provincial Reconstruction Team then based in northern Afghanistan to Helmand province in the South, along with an infantry battlegroup and full helicopter support – around 2,500 personnel.</p><p>As described under the heading 'Iraqiisation' below, the proposals to transfer responsibility for security in the four provinces of MND(SE) to Iraqi control were based on high-risk assumptions about the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the lead for security. If those assumptions proved to be inaccurate and the UK was unable to withdraw, agreement to the Helmand deployment in Afghanistan effectively constrained the UK's ability to respond by increasing troop levels in Iraq.</p><p>In January 2006, Cabinet approved the decision to deploy to Helmand. Dr Reid, the Defence Secretary, announced that the UK was <span class="quote">"preparing for a deployment to southern Afghanistan"</span> which included a Provincial Reconstruction Team as <span class="quote">"part of a larger, more than 3,300-strong British force providing the security framework"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-253" id="footnote-253-ref"><sup>253</sup></a></p><p>The impact of that decision was summarised neatly by Gen Walker as:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Militarily, the UK force structure is already stretched and, with two concurrent medium scale operations in prospect, will soon become exceptionally so in niche areas."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-254" id="footnote-254-ref"><sup>254</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Niche capabilities such as helicopter support and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) were essential to the successful conduct of operations.</p><p>From July 2005 onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were effectively made under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan. Although Iraq remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of a substantial reinforcement of its forces there, should it have considered one necessary. When the US announced in January 2007 that it would send a surge of resources to Iraq, the UK was consequently unable to contemplate a parallel surge of its own.</p><p>The impact of the decision to deploy to Helmand on the availability of key equipment capabilities for Iraq, and on the level of stretch felt by military personnel, is addressed in Sections 14 and 16.</p><p></p><h3>Iraqiisation</h3><p></p><p>After becoming Defence Secretary in May 2005, Dr Reid had continued the policy of reducing UK troop levels based on the transition of lead responsibility for security to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). In one of his early acts as Defence Secretary, he announced the deployment of just over 400 additional personnel to enhance the UK's effort in training the ISF, which would <span class="quote">"enable them to take on ever greater responsibility for their own security and so pave the way for UK troops to withdraw"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-255" id="footnote-255-ref"><sup>255</sup></a></p><p>The proposals for transfer of the four provinces in MND(SE) to Iraqi control agreed in July 2005 suggested transition from MNF-I to ISF primacy in Basra from March 2006, based on the assumption that the ISF would, by that point, be capable of taking on responsibility for security in what was likely to remain a very challenging environment.</p><p>There was sufficient reliable contemporary evidence available, including from the JIC and in reports from commanders in theatre, to demonstrate that the assumption that the ISF would be ready to take the lead in Basra by that point was probably unrealistic.</p><p>In September 2005, Mr Blair expressed his concerns about ISF capability, following reports of police involvement in attacks on the MNF in Basra. But despite concerns that had been expressed about the capacity of the ISF, Dr Reid recommended that a reduction in UK forces should take place in October or November 2005.</p><p>A few days after Dr Reid made his recommendation, the Jameat incident in Basra (see Section 12.1) raised questions about the ISF in MND(SE). Officials from the FCO, the MOD and DFID judged that the incident had highlighted the risks to achieving UK objectives in MND(SE), and that those risks had implications for military resources. Nevertheless, assumptions about ISF readiness were not re-examined by Ministers. The incident should have prompted a more searching analysis of whether the conditions necessary for drawdown were likely to be met within the planned timetable. Reluctance to consider the potential implications of the Jameat incident obscured what it had revealed about the security situation in MND(SE).</p><p>The critical importance of ISF capability in assessing readiness for transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control, on which UK plans to draw down were based, was emphasised by the 'Conditions for Provincial Transfer' published by the Joint Iraqi/MNF Committee to Transfer Security Responsibility, and by Dr Reid, who told DOP(I) that <span class="quote">"successful Iraqiisation remains the key"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-256" id="footnote-256-ref"><sup>256</sup></a> DOP(I) decided that Dr Reid should have lead responsibility for building the capacity of the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) in Basra in addition to his responsibility for the Iraqi Army.</p><p>In October 2005, Mr Blair asked for a major and sustained push to make progress on the ability of the ISF to take the lead on security. Gen Jackson raised concerns about ISF effectiveness in a minute to Gen Walker, and concluded: <span class="quote">"it is not to our credit that we have known about the inadequacies of the IPS for so long and yet failed to address them"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-257" id="footnote-257-ref"><sup>257</sup></a> The Assessments Staff reinforced the lack of progress in reforming the ISF.</p><p>In October 2005, the Chiefs of Staff made a stark assessment of the insurgency and coalition strategy in Iraq. They concluded that <span class="quote">"Ministers needed to be clear that the campaign could potentially be heading for 'strategic failure', with grave national and international consequences if the appropriate actions were not taken"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-258" id="footnote-258-ref"><sup>258</sup></a> Gen Walker judged that only 5 percent of UK military effort in MND(SE) was devoted to counter-insurgency operations. But neither Air Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, Commander Joint Operations, nor Gen Walker reassessed UK force requirements in Iraq, based on those two assessments.</p><p>The security situation at this point should have resulted in a reassessment of the UK troop levels needed to achieve the UK's key outcomes in MND(SE). Although the responsibility for tactical decision-making rested with commanders on the ground, it was for Gen Walker to ensure that those commanders had sufficient resources to deliver.</p><p>The absence of additional resources placed further pressure on the UK's ability to deliver the conditions required for transfer. At the end of 2005 and in early 2006 there were further indications that the ISF were not ready to operate alone. The MOD reported to the final DOP(I) meeting of 2005 that the capacity of the Iraqi administration and security forces to assume responsibility, acknowledging the challenge of increasing sectarianism and militia infiltration, was one of the key challenges remaining.</p><p>In March 2006, the JIC again highlighted doubts about the ability of the Iraqi Army to operate without MNF support and concerns about the corruption and infiltration of the IPS.</p><p>US concerns about UK plans for the transition of Maysan and Muthanna to Iraqi control in May were such that Dr Reid adapted them to include a small residual team providing mentoring and support to the Iraqi Army.</p><p>Dr Reid continued to press ahead with drawdown and announced that troop levels would reduce in May 2006 from approximately 8,000 to around 7,200 based on <span class="quote">"completion of various security sector reform tasks, a reduction in the support levels for those tasks, and recent efficiency measures in theatre"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-259" id="footnote-259-ref"><sup>259</sup></a> That rationale did not include an assessment of the effect of those tasks on the capability of the ISF.</p><h3 id="preparation-for-withdrawal">Preparation for withdrawal</h3><p></p><h3>A Major Divergence In Strategy</h3><p></p><p>US and UK strategies for Iraq had in effect been on different courses since the UK decision to focus its attention on MND(SE) in 2003. As a result of that decision, the UK had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US. It was only marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilising the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for drawdown.</p><p>For some time, there had been indications of tension between the US and UK regarding assessments of progress, and differing assumptions about whether plans were needed for long-term bases in Iraq. In May 2006, Mr Blair was told about <span class="quote">"rumblings from the US system about UK failure to grip the security situation in what they regard as a strategically vital part of Iraq"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-260" id="footnote-260-ref"><sup>260</sup></a> Gen Jackson felt compelled to report that:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"The perception, right or wrong, in some – if not all – US military circles is that the UK is motivated more by the short-term political gain of early withdrawal than by the long-term importance of mission accomplishment; and that, as a result, MND(SE)'s operational posture is too laissez faire and lacks initiative ..."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-261" id="footnote-261-ref"><sup>261</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>In January 2007, the divergence between US and UK strategies was thrown into sharp relief by President Bush's announcement that the US would adopt a new strategy, of which a prominent feature would be the deployment of a surge of US forces, primarily to Baghdad and its environs. UK assessments of the prospects for the new US policy were bleak, reflecting widespread pessimism about the prospects for Iraq. UK strategy continued to look towards withdrawal.</p><p>US concerns about the differences in approach were evident. In February 2007, Sir David Manning, British Ambassador to the US, reported that Secretary Rice had asked him <span class="quote">"to tell her honestly whether the UK was now making for the exit as fast as possible"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-262" id="footnote-262-ref"><sup>262</sup></a></p><p>The divergence in strategies was also illustrated by the conditions-based process through which the four provinces in MND(SE) were transferred to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC) during 2007. Although each transfer was signed off by senior members of the US military, there was persistent reporting of US concerns about readiness for PIC, whether the conditions had actually been met and the wider impact of transfer.</p><p>The US was also uncomfortable about arrangements made by the UK with a militia group in Basra which allowed the safe exit of UK troops from their main base in the city.</p><p></p><h3>A Possible Civil War</h3><p></p><p>By March 2006, senior members of the UK military were considering the possibility of civil war in Iraq, prompted by rising levels of sectarian violence and concerns that the Iraqi Government was <span class="quote">"not ... perceived as even-handed in security issues"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-263" id="footnote-263-ref"><sup>263</sup></a> The risk of civil war had been acknowledged by Prime Minister Ibrahim Ja'afari in the wake of the bombing of the al-Askari mosque in February. Although there was general agreement that the situation in Iraq did not constitute civil war, the risk that one might develop was considered to be real.</p><p>At this time, the presence in Iraq of the MNF was authorised by resolution 1637 (2005). The exchange of letters between Prime Minister Ja'afari and the President of the Security Council which accompanied the resolution clearly identified providing security for the Iraqi people as the reason why a continued MNF presence was necessary.</p><p>In late April, FCO officials were concerned that security in Basra was declining and that a determined and sustained effort, including a more assertive military posture, would be required to deliver the UK's objective of transferring Basra to Iraqi control by late 2006 or early 2007.</p><p>Accounts from mid-2006 suggested that security in MND(SE) was a significant concern, characterised by <span class="quote">"steady, if generally unspectacular, decline"</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-264" id="footnote-264-ref"><sup>264</sup></a> and increased militia activity. The UK military's approach had generated US concern and the security situation was limiting UK civilian activity.</p><p>Gen Jackson's assessment in May of the short-term security prospects in Iraq was bleak. He judged that <span class="quote">"what we will leave behind will not look much like strategic success. Ten years hence our strategy may fully bear fruit."</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-265" id="footnote-265-ref"><sup>265</sup></a></p><p>After visiting Iraq in early May, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, advised Dr Reid that there should be no change to the operational approach and that there were <span class="quote">"compelling reasons"</span> why the UK should <span class="quote">"press on"</span> with handing over security to Iraq, including to permit the UK's continuing build-up in Afghanistan.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-266" id="footnote-266-ref"><sup>266</sup></a> ACM Stirrup identified the risk that UK withdrawal from Basra would be seen as a <span class="quote">"strategic failure"</span> and suggested that <span class="quote">"astute conditioning of the UK public may be necessary"</span> to avoid that.</p><p>ACM Stirrup's view that the UK should press ahead with drawdown despite the security challenges in Basra was not consistent with Government policy that withdrawal should be conditions-based.</p><p>ACM Stirrup's acceptance that the <span class="quote">"law of diminishing returns"</span> was <span class="quote">"now firmly in play"</span> and that there was <span class="quote">"an increasing risk"</span> that UK forces would <span class="quote">"become part of the problem, rather than the solution"</span> had some validity: it was clear from accounts of the situation in Basra that UK forces were not preventing a steady decline in security. ACM Stirrup was also right to advise Dr Reid that the MNF in Iraq faced a <span class="quote">"multifaceted"</span>, sophisticated and dangerous enemy; that serious issues remained in Basra (militia activity, poor governance, insecurity); and that it was possible the UK would be accused of strategic failure.</p><p>The established policy was that UK forces would withdraw as the capabilities of the ISF increased until responsibility could be handed over to the Iraqi Government. ACM Stirrup's proposed remedy of continued drawdown and managing public opinion did not mitigate the risk of strategic failure he described.</p><p>In the summer of 2006, in recognition of the need to stabilise Basra and prepare it for transition to Iraqi control, the UK developed the Basra Security Plan, <span class="quote">"a plan to improve Basra through operations, high impact reconstruction and SSR [Security Sector Reform] ... lasting for up to six months"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-267" id="footnote-267-ref"><sup>267</sup></a> The military element of the plan became known as Operation SALAMANCA and included operations against militia groups.</p><p>In August 2006, ACM Stirrup was asked to give direction on both seeking US help for Op SALAMANCA and the possibility of deploying UK forces to support US operations outside MND(SE).</p><p>While ACM Stirrup stressed the importance of senior Iraqi political support if Op SALAMANCA was to be a success, Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, the Senior British Military Representative – Iraq, indicated a concern that even with US support the capabilities available in MND(SE) might not be sufficient successfully to deliver Op SALAMANCA.</p><p>ACM Stirrup directed that it was acceptable for the UK to make use of US enablers, such as aviation, in MND(SE), but that, in general, commitments in MND(SE) were to be met by existing MND(SE) personnel (including contractors) and any shortfalls were to be identified and considered appropriately.</p><p>ACM Stirrup also directed that the deployment of UK troops to Multi-National Division (Centre South):</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... crossed a clear policy 'red line' and seemed counter-intuitive, given that consideration was also being given to obtaining US forces for MND(SE). The UK needed to draw down its force levels as soon as practicable, both in MND(SE) and elsewhere."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-268" id="footnote-268-ref"><sup>268</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The decision not to allow the use of US support in Basra was an important one. The Inquiry considers that the question of what was needed to make Op SALAMANCA a success should have been addressed directly by ACM Stirrup, whose response instead precluded proper consideration of whether additional UK resources would be required.</p><p>There was continuing resistance to any suggestion that UK forces should operate outside MND(SE) and there may have been concern that US participation in Op SALAMANCA would have led to an obligation on the UK to engage more outside MND(SE). This might not, as ACM Stirrup observed, be consistent with a commitment to drawdown, but might have reduced the risk of strategic failure.</p><p>The nature of Op SALAMANCA was constrained by the Iraqi Government in September 2006, so that the eventual operation (renamed Operation SINBAD) left <span class="quote">"Basra in the hands of the militant militia and death squads, with the ISF unable to impose, let alone maintain, the rule of law"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-269" id="footnote-269-ref"><sup>269</sup></a> This contributed to the conditions which led the UK into negotiations with JAM in early 2007.</p><p>Attempts were subsequently made to present Op SINBAD as equivalent to the 2007 US surge. Although there was some resemblance between the <span class="quote">"Clear, Hold, Build"</span> tactics to be used by US surge forces and the UK's tactics for Op SINBAD, the UK operation did not deploy sufficient additional resources to conduct <span class="quote">"Hold"</span> and <span class="quote">"Build"</span> phases with anything like the same strategic effect. The additional 360 troops deployed by the UK could not have had the same effect as the more than 20,000 troops surged into Baghdad and its environs by the US.</p><p>At the end of 2006, tensions between the military and civilian teams in MND(SE) became explicit. In a report to Mr Blair, Major General Richard Shirreff, General Officer Commanding MND(SE), diagnosed that the existing arrangement, in which the Provincial Reconstruction Team was located in Kuwait, <span class="quote">"lacks unity of command and unity of purpose"</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-270" id="footnote-270-ref"><sup>270</sup></a> and proposed the establishment of a <span class="quote">"Joint Inter-Agency Task Force"</span> in Basra led by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE).</p><p>ACM Stirrup's advice to Mr Blair was that it was <span class="quote">"too late"</span> to implement Maj Gen Shirreff's proposal. That may have been the right conclusion, but the effect was to deter consideration of a real problem and of ways in which military and civilian operations in MND(SE) could be better aligned.</p><p>The adequacy of UK force levels in Iraq and the effectiveness of the UK's efforts in MND(SE) were explicitly questioned in Maj Gen Shirreff's end of tour report.</p><p></p><h3>Force Level Review</h3><p></p><p>The balance of forces between Iraq and Afghanistan was reviewed by DOP in February 2007 on the basis that the UK could only sustain the enduring operational deployment of eight battlegroups.</p><p>ACM Stirrup's <span class="quote">"strong advice"</span>,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-271" id="footnote-271-ref"><sup>271</sup></a> with which DOP agreed, was that the UK should provide two additional battlegroups to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, reducing the Iraq to Afghanistan battlegroup ratio from 6:2 to 5:3 and then 4:4.</p><p>This advice did not include an assessment of either the actual state of security in Basra or the impact on the UK's ability to deliver its objectives (including that drawdown should be conditions-based) and responsibilities under resolution 1723 (2006). The advice did identify US <span class="quote">"nervousness"</span> about the UK proposals.</p><p>In early May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair's Foreign Policy Adviser, sought ACM Stirrup's advice on the future of the UK military presence in Iraq. ACM Stirrup advised that the UK should press ahead with drawdown from Iraq on the basis that there was little more the UK could achieve. There was <span class="quote">"no militarily useful mission"</span>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-272" id="footnote-272-ref"><sup>272</sup></a></p><p>Mr Blair was concerned about the implications of ACM Stirrup's position unless the political circumstances in Basra changed first. He commented: <span class="quote">"it will be very hard to present as anything other than a total withdrawal ... it cd be very dangerous for the stability of Iraq, &amp; the US will, rightly, be v. concerned."</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-273" id="footnote-273-ref"><sup>273</sup></a></p><p>After visiting Basra again in mid-May, ACM Stirrup continued to recommend the drawdown of UK forces. But other contemporary evidence indicated a more negative picture of circumstances in Basra than ACM Stirrup's view that:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"... the Iraqis are increasingly in a position to take on responsibility for their own problems and therefore they might wish to look to propose the south of the country as a model through which we can recommend a drawdown of forces."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-274" id="footnote-274-ref"><sup>274</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>In July 2007, FCO and MOD officials recognised that leaving Basra Palace would mean moving to PIC in fact if not in name. Mr Brown, who had become Prime Minister in June, was keen that the gap between leaving the Palace and transfer to PIC should be as small as possible, since UK situational awareness and ability to conduct operations in Basra would be limited once the Palace was no longer in use.</p><p>During a visit to Iraq at the start of July, ACM Stirrup sought to convince senior US officers that Basra was ready for transfer to PIC on the basis that it would not be possible to demonstrate readiness until after the transfer had taken place. General David Petraeus, Commanding General MNF-I, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, US Ambassador to Iraq, remained <span class="quote">"circumspect"</span> on the timing of PIC.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-275" id="footnote-275-ref"><sup>275</sup></a> They considered that there remained <span class="quote">"significant problems"</span> associated with <span class="quote">"unstable politics"</span> and <span class="quote">"JAM infiltration"</span> in Basra.</p><p>As they reached the end of their respective tours of duty, both Major General Jonathan Shaw, General Officer Commanding MND(SE) from January to August 2007, and Lieutenant General William Rollo, Senior British Military Representative – Iraq from July 2007 to March 2008, identified the impact of limited resources on the UK's military effort and questioned the drive for continued drawdown in Iraq in order to prioritise resources for Helmand. Maj Gen Shaw wrote: <span class="quote">"We have been hamstrung for resources throughout the tour, driven by the rising strategic significance of the Afghan deployment."</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-276" id="footnote-276-ref"><sup>276</sup></a></p><p>During a visit to Iraq in October 2007, ACM Stirrup was briefed by Major General Graham Binns, General Office Commanding MND(SE) from August 2007 to February 2008, that the ISF might have only limited ability to cope in the event that JAM resumed combat operations. The JIC and others also identified continued weaknesses in the ISF.

That such an important operation came as a surprise was an indication of the distance between the UK and Iraqi Governments at this point.</p><p>When the Charge of the Knights began, the UK found itself to be both compromised in the eyes of the Iraqi Government and unable to offer significant operational support, as a result of the tactical decision to negotiate with JAM1 and the absence of situational awareness in Basra after withdrawing from the Basra Palace site.</p><p>On 1 April, ACM Stirrup briefed the Overseas and Defence Sub-Committee of the National Security, International Relations and Development Committee (NSID(OD)) that the UK military task would be complete by the end of 2008; its timetable would not be affected by the Charge of the Knights.</p><p>ACM Stirrup's conclusion that there was no need to review UK drawdown plans was premature in the light of both the level of uncertainty generated by the Charge of the Knights and continued questions about the ability of the ISF to take the security lead in Basra.</p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2 id="did-the-uk-achieve-its-objectives-in-iraq">Did the UK achieve its objectives in Iraq?</h2><p>From mid-2005 onwards, various senior individuals – officials, military officers and Ministers – began to consider whether the UK was heading towards <span class="quote">"strategic failure"</span> in Iraq.</p><p>The term <span class="quote">"strategic failure"</span> was variously used to mean:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>the development of a widespread sectarian conflict or civil war in Iraq;</p></li><li><p><span class="quote">"victory"</span> for terrorist groups;</p></li><li><p>collapse of the democratic process;</p></li><li><p>failure to achieve the UK's objectives;</p></li><li><p>failure to achieve a stable and secure environment in Basra;</p></li><li><p>the collapse of the UK/Iraq relationship;</p></li><li><p>the division of Iraq and the end of its existence as a nation state;</p></li><li><p>damage to the UK's military and political reputation; and</p></li><li><p>damage to the relationship between the US and UK.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>None of the contemporary accounts that the Inquiry has considered reached the conclusion that strategic failure was inevitable, although most recognised that without some form of corrective action it was a serious risk.</p><p>Although the UK revisited its Iraq strategy with considerable frequency, no substantial change in approach was ever implemented: UK troop numbers continued to reduce; the size of the civilian deployment varied very little; the Iraqiisation of security and handover of responsibility to the Iraqi Government remained key objectives.</p><p>The Iraq of 2009 certainly did not meet the UK's objectives as described in January 2003: it fell far short of strategic success. Although the borders of Iraq were the same as they had been in 2003, deep sectarian divisions threatened both stability and unity. Those divisions were not created by the coalition, but they were exacerbated by its decisions on de-Ba'athification and on demobilisation of the Iraqi Army and were not addressed by an effective programme of reconciliation.</p><p>In January 2009, the JIC judged <span class="quote">"internal political failures that could lead to renewed violence within and between Iraq's Sunni, Shia and Kurdish communities"</span><a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-278" id="footnote-278-ref"><sup>278</sup></a> to be the greatest strategic threat to Iraq's stability.</p><p>The fragility of the situation in Basra, which had been the focus of UK effort in MND(SE), was clear. The JIC assessed that threats remained from Iranian-backed JAM Special Groups, and the Iraqi Security Forces remained reliant on support from Multi-National Forces to address weaknesses in leadership and tactical support. Even as UK troops withdrew from Basra, the US was sufficiently concerned to deploy its own forces there, to secure the border and protect supply lines.</p><p>In 2009, Iraq did have a democratically elected Parliament, in which many of Iraq's communities were represented. But, as demonstrated by the protracted process of negotiating agreements on the status of US and then UK forces in Iraq, and the continued absence of a much-needed Hydrocarbons Law, representation did not translate into effective government. In 2008, Transparency International judged Iraq to be the third most corrupt country in the world, and in mid-2009 the Assessments Staff judged that Government ministries were <span class="quote">"riddled with"</span> corruption.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-279" id="footnote-279-ref"><sup>279</sup></a></p><p>By 2009, it had been demonstrated that some elements of the UK's 2003 objectives for Iraq were misjudged. No evidence had been identified that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, with which it might threaten its neighbours and the international community more widely. But in the years between 2003 and 2009, events in Iraq had undermined regional stability, including by allowing Al Qaida space in which to operate and unsecured borders across which its members might move.</p><p>The gap between the ambitious objectives with which the UK entered Iraq and the resources that the Government was prepared to commit to the task was substantial from the start. Even with more resources it would have been difficult to achieve those objectives, as a result of the circumstances of the invasion, the lack of international support, the inadequacy of planning and preparation, and the inability to deliver law and order. The lack of security hampered progress at every turn. It is therefore not surprising that, despite the considerable efforts made by UK civilian and military personnel over this period, the results were meagre.</p><p>The Inquiry has not been able to identify alternative approaches that would have guaranteed greater success in the circumstances of March 2003. What can be said is that a number of opportunities for the sort of candid reappraisal of policies that would have better aligned objectives and resources did not take place. There was no serious consideration of more radical options, such as an early withdrawal or else a substantial increase in effort. The Inquiry has identified a number of moments, especially during the first year of the Occupation, when it would have been possible to conduct a substantial reappraisal.

The focus on the quantity of officers trained for the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than the quality of officers, was simplistic and gave a misleading sense of comfort.</p></li><li><p>After 2006, the UK's determination to withdraw from Iraq meant that aspirations for the Iraqi Security Forces were lowered to what would be <span class="quote">"good enough"</span> for Iraq. It was never clear what that meant in practice.</p></li><li><p>The development of the Iraqi Army was considerably more successful than that of the Iraqi Police Service.

In total, 89 percent of that was spent on military operations.</p></li><li><p>The Government's decision to take part in military action against Iraq was not affected by consideration of the potential financial cost to the UK of the invasion or the post-conflict period.</p></li><li><p>Ministers were not provided with estimates of military conflict and post-conflict costs, or with advice on their affordability, when decisions were taken on the scale of the UK's military contribution to a US-led invasion of Iraq, and on the UK's role in the post-conflict period. They should have been.</p></li><li><p>There was no articulated need for additional financial resources for military operations in Iraq that was not met.</p></li><li><p>The arrangements for funding military Urgent Operational Requirements and other military costs worked as intended, and did not constrain the UK military's ability to conduct operations in Iraq.</p></li><li><p>The controls imposed by the Treasury on the MOD's budget in September 2003 did not constrain the UK military's ability to conduct operations in Iraq.</p></li><li><p>The Government was slow to recognise that Iraq was an enduring operation, and to adapt its funding arrangements to support both military operations and civilian activities.</p></li><li><p>The arrangements for securing funding for civilian activities could be slow and unpredictable.

The range of protected mobility options available to commanders in MND(SE) was limited. Although work had begun before 2002 to source an additional PPV, it was only ordered in July 2006 following Ministerial intervention.</p></li><li><p>Funding was not a direct barrier to the identification and deployment of additional solutions to the medium weight PPV gap. But it appears that the longer-term focus of the Executive Committee of the Army Board on the Future Rapid Effect System programme inhibited it from addressing the more immediate issue related to medium weight PPV capability.</p></li><li><p>The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan had a material impact on the availability of key capabilities for deployment to Iraq, particularly helicopters and ISTAR.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 id="civilian-personnel">Civilian personnel</h3><p>The following key findings are from Section 15.2, and relate to evidence in Section 15.1:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Before the invasion of Iraq, the Government had made only minimal preparations for the deployment of civilian personnel.</p></li><li><p>There was an enduring gap between the Government's civilian capacity and the level of its ambition in Iraq.</p></li><li><p>There was no overarching consideration by the Government of the extent to which civilians could be effective in a highly insecure environment, or of the security assets needed for civilians to do their jobs effectively.</p></li><li><p>The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that the Government recognised its duty of care to UK-based and locally engaged civilians in Iraq.

The MOD progressively improved how it engaged with and supported bereaved families, in part driven by consistent public and Ministerial pressure.</p></li><li><p>The Government's decision in 2006 to deploy a second medium scale force to Helmand province in Afghanistan further increased the pressure on Service Personnel, on elements of the MOD's welfare, medical and investigative systems, and the coronial system.</p></li><li><p>Much of the MOD's and the Government's effort from 2006 was focused on addressing those pressures.</p></li><li><p>The MOD should have planned and prepared to address those pressures, rather than react to them.</p></li><li><p>The Government should have acted sooner to address the backlog of inquests into the deaths of Service Personnel.

The MOD's responses offered reassurance based on the tight targeting procedures governing the air campaign.</p></li><li><p>The MOD made only a broad estimate of direct civilian casualties arising from an attack on Iraq, based on previous operations.</p></li><li><p>With hindsight, greater efforts should have been made in the post-conflict period to determine the number of civilian casualties and the broader effects of military operations on civilians. More time was devoted to the question of which department should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than it was to efforts to determine the actual number.</p></li><li><p>The Government's consideration of the issue of Iraqi civilian casualties was driven by its concern to rebut accusations that Coalition Forces were responsible for the deaths of large numbers of civilians, and to sustain domestic support for operations in Iraq.</p></li></ul><p></p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2><p>In a number of Sections of this Report, the Inquiry has set out explicit lessons. They relate in particular to those elements of the UK's engagement in Iraq which might be replicated in future operations.</p><p>The decision to join the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the product of a particular set of circumstances which are unlikely to be repeated. Unlike other instances in which military force has been used, the invasion was not prompted by the aggression of another country or an unfolding humanitarian disaster. The lessons drawn by the Inquiry on the pre-conflict element of this Report are therefore largely context-specific and embedded in its conclusions. Lessons on collective Ministerial decision-making, where the principles identified are enduring ones, are an exception. They, and other lessons which have general application, are set out below.</p><h3 id="the-decision-to-go-to-war">The decision to go to war</h3><p>In a democratic system, public support and understanding for a major military operation are essential. It is therefore important to guard against overstating what military action might achieve and against any tendency to play down the risks. A realistic assessment of the possibilities and limitations of armed force, and of the challenges of intervening in the affairs of other States, should help any future UK Government manage expectations, including its own.</p><p>When the potential for military action arises, the Government should not commit to a firm political objective before it is clear that it can be achieved. Regular reassessment is essential, to ensure that the assumptions upon which policy is being made and implemented remain correct.</p><p>Once an issue becomes a matter for the Security Council, the UK Government cannot expect to retain control of how it is to be discussed and eventually decided unless it is able to work with the interests and agendas of other Member States. In relation to Iraq, the independent role of the inspectors was a further dimension.</p><p>A military timetable should not be allowed to dictate a diplomatic timetable. If a strategy of coercive diplomacy is being pursued, forces should be deployed in such a way that the threat of action can be increased or decreased according to the diplomatic situation and the policy can be sustained for as long as necessary.</p><p>The issue of influencing the US, both at the strategic and at the operational level, was a constant preoccupation at all levels of the UK Government.</p><p>Prime Ministers will always wish to exercise their own political judgement on how to handle the relationship with the US. It will depend on personal relationships as well as on the nature of the issues being addressed. On all these matters of strategy and diplomacy, the Inquiry recognises that there is no standard formula that will be appropriate in all cases.</p><p>Whether or not influence has been exercised can be difficult to ascertain, even in retrospect. The views of allies are most likely to make a difference when they come in one side of an internal debate, and there are a number of instances where the UK arguments did make a difference to the formation and implementation of US policy. The US and UK are close allies, but the relationship between the two is unequal.</p><p>The exercise of influence will always involve a combination of identifying the prerequisites for success in a shared endeavour, and a degree of bargaining to make sure that the approach meets the national interest. In situations like the run-up to the invasion of Iraq:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>If certain measures are identified as prerequisite for success then their importance should be underlined from the start. There are no prizes for sharing a failure.</p></li><li><p>Those measures that are most important should be pursued persistently and consistently.</p></li><li><p>If it is assumed that a consequence of making a contribution in one area is that a further contribution would not be required in another, then that should be made explicit.</p></li><li><p>Influence should not be set as an objective in itself. The exercise of influence is a means to an end.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 id="weapons-of-mass-destruction">Weapons of mass destruction</h3><p>There will continue to be demands for factual evidence to explain the background to controversial policy decisions including, where appropriate, the explicit and public use of assessed intelligence.</p><p>The Inquiry shares the Butler Review's conclusions that it was a mistake not to see the risk of combining in the September dossier the JIC's assessment of intelligence and other evidence with the interpretation and presentation of the evidence in order to make the case for policy action.</p><p>The nature of the two functions is fundamentally different. As can be seen from the JIC Assessments quoted in, and published with, this report, they contain careful language intended to ensure that no more weight is put on the evidence than it can bear. Organising the evidence in order to present an argument in the language of Ministerial statements produces a quite different type of document.</p><p>The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the firmness of the evidence about Iraq's capabilities and intentions in order to influence opinion and <span class="quote">"make the case"</span> for action to disarm Iraq has produced a damaging legacy, including undermining trust and confidence in Government statements, particularly those which rely on intelligence which cannot be independently verified.</p><p>As a result, in situations where the policy response may involve military action and the evidence, at least in part, depends on inferential judgements drawn from necessarily incomplete intelligence, it may be more difficult to secure support for the Government's position and agreement to action.</p><p>The explicit and public use of material from JIC Assessments to underpin policy decisions will be infrequent. But, from the evidence on the compilation of the September dossier, the lessons for any similar exercise in future would be:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>The need for clear separation of the responsibility for analysis and assessment of intelligence from the responsibility for making the argument for a policy.</p></li><li><p>The importance of precision in describing the position. In the case of the September dossier, for instance, the term <span class="quote">"programme"</span> was used to describe disparate activities at very different stages of maturity. There was a <span class="quote">"programme"</span> to extend the range of the Al Samoud missile. There was no <span class="quote">"programme"</span> in any meaningful sense to develop and produce nuclear weapons. Use of the shorthand CW or BW in relation to Iraq's capability obscured whether the reference was to weapons or warfare. Constant use of the term <span class="quote">"weapons of mass destruction"</span> without further clarification obscured the differences between the potential impact of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and the ability to deliver them effectively. For example, there would be a considerable difference between the effects of an artillery shell filled with mustard gas, which is a battlefield weapon, and a long-range ballistic missile with a chemical or biological warhead, which is a weapon of terror.</p></li><li><p>The need to identify and accurately describe the confidence and robustness of the evidence base. There may be evidence which is <span class="quote">"authoritative"</span> or which puts an issue <span class="quote">"beyond doubt"</span>; but there are unlikely to be many circumstances when those descriptions could properly be applied to inferential judgements relying on intelligence.</p></li><li><p>The need to be explicit about the likelihood of events. The possibility of Iraq producing and using an improvised nuclear device was, rightly, omitted from the dossier. But the claim that Iraq could build a nuclear weapon within one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other essential components from foreign sources was included without addressing how feasible and likely that would be. In addition, the Executive Summary gave prominence to the International Institute of Strategic Studies suggestion that Iraq would be able to assemble nuclear weapons within months if it could obtain fissile material, without reference to the material in the main text of the dossier which made clear that the UK took a very different view.</p></li><li><p>The need to be scrupulous in discriminating between facts and knowledge on the one hand and opinion, judgement or belief on the other.</p></li><li><p>The need for vigilance to avoid unwittingly crossing the line from supposition to certainty, including by constant repetition of received wisdom.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>When assessed intelligence is explicitly and publicly used to support a policy decision, there would be benefit in subjecting that assessment and the underpinning intelligence to subsequent scrutiny, by a suitable, independent body, such as the Intelligence and Security Committee, with a view to identifying lessons for the future.</p><p>In the context of the lessons from the preparation of the September 2002 dossier, the Inquiry identifies in Section 4.2 the benefits of separating the responsibilities for assessment of intelligence from setting out the arguments in support of a policy.</p><p>The evidence in Section 4.3 reinforces that lesson. It shows that the intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq's capabilities and intent continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of the intelligence.</p><p>The independence and impartiality of the JIC remains of the utmost importance.</p><p>As the Foreign Affairs Committee report in July 2003 pointed out, the late Sir Percy Cradock wrote in his history of the JIC that:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"Ideally, intelligence and policy should be close but distinct. Too distinct and assessments become an in-growing, self-regarding activity, producing little or no work of interest to the decision-makers ... Too close a link and policy begins to play back on estimates, producing the answers the policy makers would like ... The analysts become courtiers, whereas their proper function is to report their findings ... without fear or favour. The best arrangement is intelligence and policy in separate but adjoining rooms, with communicating doors and thin partition walls ..."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-280" id="footnote-280-ref"><sup>280</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>Mr Straw told the FAC in 2003:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"The reason why we have a Joint Intelligence Committee which is separate from the intelligence agencies is precisely so that those who are obtaining the intelligence are John Murray, 2002. not then directly making the assessment upon it. That is one of the very important strengths of our system compared with most other systems around the world."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-281" id="footnote-281-ref"><sup>281</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><p>The FAC endorsed those sentiments.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-282" id="footnote-282-ref"><sup>282</sup></a> It stated that the JIC has a <span class="quote">"vital role in safeguarding the independence and impartiality of intelligence"</span>; and that the <span class="quote">"independence and impartiality of its own role"</span> was <span class="quote">"of the utmost importance"</span>. It recommended that Ministers should <span class="quote">"bear in mind at all times the importance of ensuring that the JIC is free of all political pressure"</span>.</p><p>In its response to the FAC, the Government stated:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>"We agree. The JIC plays a crucial role in providing the Government with objective assessments on a range of issues of importance to national interests."<a epub:type="noteref" href="#footnote-283" id="footnote-283-ref"><sup>283</sup></a></p><p></p></blockquote><h3 id="the-invasion-of-iraq">The invasion of Iraq</h3><p>The military plan for the invasion of Iraq depended for success on a rapid advance on Baghdad, including convincing the Iraqi population of the Coalition's determination to remove the regime.</p><p>By the end of March, the Government had recognised the need for sustained communication of key strategic messages and improved capabilities to reach a range of audiences in the UK, Iraq and the wider international community. But there was clearly a need for more robust arrangements to integrate Coalition efforts in the UK, US and the forces deployed in Iraq.</p><p>The reaction of the media and the Iraqi population to perceived difficulties encountered within days of the start of an operation, which was planned to last up to 125 days, might have been anticipated if there had been more rigorous examination of possible scenarios pre-conflict and the media had better understood the original concept of operations and the nature of the Coalition responses to the situations they encountered once the campaign began.</p><p>The difficulty and complexity of successfully delivering distinct strategic messages to each of the audiences a government needs to reach should not be underestimated. For any future military operations, arrangements tailored to meet the circumstances of each operation need to be put in place in both London and on the ground before operations begin.</p><p>When the UK acceded to the US request that it assume leadership of a military Area of Responsibility encompassing four provinces in southern Iraq, it did so without a robust analysis either of the strategic implications for the UK or of the military's capacity to support the UK's potential obligations in the region.</p><p>A step of such magnitude should be taken deliberately and having considered the wider strategic and resource implications and contingent liabilities.</p><p>That requires all government departments whose responsibilities will be engaged to have been formally involved in providing Ministers with coherent inter-departmental advice before decisions are taken; the proper function of the Cabinet Committee system.</p><h3 id="the-postconflict-period">The post-conflict period</h3><p>The UK had not participated in an opposed invasion and full-scale occupation of a sovereign State (followed by shared responsibility for security and reconstruction over a long period) since the end of the Second World War. The particular circumstances of Op TELIC are unlikely to recur. Nevertheless, there are lessons to be drawn about major operations abroad and the UK's approach to armed intervention.</p><p>The UK did not achieve its objectives, despite the best efforts and acceptance of risk in a dangerous environment by military and civilian personnel.</p><p>Although the UK expected to be involved in Iraq for a lengthy period after the conflict, the Government was unprepared for the role in which the UK found itself from April 2003. Much of what went wrong stemmed from that lack of preparation.</p><p>In any undertaking of this kind, certain fundamental elements are of vital importance:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>the best possible appreciation of the theatre of operations, including the political, cultural and ethnic background, and the state of society, the economy and infrastructure;</p></li><li><p>a hard-headed assessment of risks;</p></li><li><p>objectives which are realistic within that context, and if necessary limited – rather than idealistic and based on optimistic assumptions; and</p></li><li><p>allocation of the resources necessary for the task – both military and civil.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>All of these elements were lacking in the UK's approach to its role in post-conflict Iraq.</p><p>Where responsibility is to be shared, it is essential to have written agreement in advance on how decision-making and governance will operate within an alliance or coalition. The UK normally acts with allies, as it did in Iraq. Within the NATO Alliance, the rules and mechanisms for decision-taking and the sharing of responsibility have been developed over time and are well understood. The Coalition in Iraq, by contrast, was an ad hoc alliance. The UK tried to establish some governance principles in the Memorandum of Understanding proposed to the US, but did not press the point. This led the UK into the uncomfortable and unsatisfactory situation of accepting shared responsibility without the ability to make a formal input to the process of decision-making.</p><p>As Iraq showed, the pattern set in the initial stage of an intervention is crucial. The maximum impact needs to be made in the early weeks and months, or opportunities missed may be lost for ever. It is very difficult to recover from a slow or damaging start.</p><p>Ground truth is vital. Over-optimistic assessments lead to bad decisions. Senior decision-makers – Ministers, Chiefs of Staff, senior officials – must have a flow of accurate and frank reporting. A <span class="quote">"can do"</span> attitude is laudably ingrained in the UK Armed Forces – a determination to get on with the job, however difficult the circumstances – but this can prevent ground truth from reaching senior ears. At times in Iraq, the bearers of bad tidings were not heard. On several occasions, decision-makers visiting Iraq (including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the General Staff) found the situation on the ground to be much worse than had been reported to them. Effective audit mechanisms need to be used to counter optimism bias, whether through changes in the culture of reporting, use of multiple channels of information – internal and external – or use of visits.</p><p>It is important to retain a flexible margin of resources – in personnel, equipment and financing – and the ability to change tactics to deal with adverse developments on the ground. In Iraq, that flexibility was lost after the parallel deployment to Helmand province in Afghanistan, which both constrained the supply of equipment (such as ISTAR) and took away the option of an effective reinforcement. Any decision to deploy to the limit of capabilities entails a high level of risk. In relation to Iraq, the risks involved in the parallel deployment of two enduring medium scale operations were not examined with sufficient rigour and challenge.</p><p>The management, in Whitehall, of a cross-government effort on the scale which was required in Iraq is a complex task. It needs dedicated leadership by someone with time, energy and influence. It cannot realistically be done by a Prime Minister alone, but requires a senior Minister with lead responsibility who has access to the Prime Minister and is therefore able to call on his or her influence in resolving problems or conflicts. A coherent inter-departmental effort, supported by a structure able to hold departments to account, is required to support such a Minister.</p><h3 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction</h3><p>The starting point for all discussions of reconstruction in circumstances comparable to those in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 must be that this is an area where progress will be extremely difficult.</p><p>Better planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq would not necessarily have prevented the events that unfolded in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. It would not have been possible for the UK to prepare for every eventuality. Better plans and preparation could have mitigated some of the risks to which the UK and Iraq were exposed between 2003 and 2009 and increased the likelihood of achieving the outcomes desired by the UK and the Iraqi people.</p><p>From late 2003, successive reviews of the UK's approach to post-conflict reconstruction, later expanded to include the broader concept of stabilisation, resulted in a series of changes to the UK's approach to post-conflict operations. Despite those changes, many of the shortcomings that characterised the UK Government's approach to pre-conflict planning and preparation in 2002 and early 2003 persisted after the invasion.</p><p>The UK Government's new strategic framework for stabilisation, the new machinery for inter-departmental co-ordination and the enhanced resources now available for stabilisation operations continue to evolve. If future changes are to increase the effectiveness of UK operations, they must address the lessons for planning, preparation and implementation derived from the Iraq experience.</p><p>The lessons identified by the Inquiry apply to both the planning and preparation for post-conflict operations, of which reconstruction is a major but not the sole component, and to post-conflict operations themselves.</p><p>Analysis of the available material must draw on multiple perspectives, reflect dissenting views, identify risk – including that associated with any gaps in knowledge – and consider a range of options.</p><p>Information must be shared as widely across departments as is necessary to support that approach.</p><p>Gathering information and analysis of the nature and scale of the potential task should be systematic and as thorough as possible, and should capture the views and aspirations of local communities.</p><p>Plans derived from that analysis should:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>incorporate a range of options appropriate to different contingencies;</p></li><li><p>reflect a realistic assessment of UK (and partners') resources and capabilities;</p></li><li><p>integrate civilian and military objectives and capabilities in support of a single UK strategy;</p></li><li><p>be exposed to scrutiny and challenge at Ministerial, senior official and expert level;</p></li><li><p>be reviewed regularly and, if the strategic context, risk profile or projected cost changes significantly, be revised.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>A government must prepare for a range of scenarios, not just the best case, and should not assume that it will be able to improvise.</p><p>Where the UK is the junior partner and is unable during planning or implementation to secure the outcome it requires, it should take stock of whether to attach conditions to continued participation and whether further involvement would be consistent with the UK's strategic interest.</p><p>Public statements on the extent of the UK's ambition should reflect a realistic assessment of what is achievable. To do otherwise is to risk even greater disillusionment and a loss of UK credibility.</p><p>Departmental priorities and interests will inevitably continue to diverge even where an inter-departmental body with a cross-government role, currently the Stabilisation Unit (SU), is in place. Therefore, co-operation between departments needs continual reinforcement at official and Ministerial levels.</p><p>The Head of the SU must be sufficiently senior and the SU enjoy recognition inside and outside government as a centre of excellence in its field if the Unit is to have credibility and influence in No.10, the National Security Council, the Treasury, the FCO, DFID and the MOD, and with the military.</p><h3 id="debaathification">De-Ba'athification</h3><p>After the fall of a repressive regime, steps inevitably have to be taken to prevent those closely identified with that regime from continuing to hold positions of influence in public life. The development of plans which minimise undesired consequences, which are administered with justice and which are based on a robust understanding of the social context in which they will be implemented, should be an essential part of preparation for any post-conflict phase. This should include measures designed to address concerns within the wider population, including those of the victims of the old regime, and to promote reconciliation.</p><p>It is vital to define carefully the scope of such measures. Bringing too many or too few individuals within scope of measures like de-Ba'athification can have far-reaching consequences for public sector capacity and for the restoration of public trust in the institutions of government.</p><p>It is also important to think through the administrative implications of the measures to be applied and the process for their implementation.</p><p>The potential for abuse means that it is essential to have thought-through forms of oversight that are as impartial and non-partisan as possible.</p><h3 id="security-sector-reform">Security Sector Reform</h3><p>An SSR strategy should define the functions of different elements of the relevant security sector and the structures needed to perform those functions. Considering those questions should drive a robust debate about how security requirements might change over time.</p><p>An understanding of the many different models that exist internationally for internal security, policing and criminal justice is essential. But those models cannot be considered in isolation because what works in one country will not necessarily work in another which may have very different traditions. It is therefore critical for the SSR strategy to take full account of the history, culture and inherited practices of the country or region in question. The strategy also needs to be informed by the views and aspirations of the local population.</p><p>A strategy should set out the desired operating standard for each function and state how that differs, if at all, from what exists. In doing so, the strategy should specify where capacity needs to be developed and inform a serious assessment of how the material resources available could best be deployed.</p><p>It is essential that the UK has an appropriate way to measure the success of any SSR plan. If a clear strategy is in place and has taken account of the views of the local population, the indicators of that success should be obvious. It should rarely concentrate on a one-dimensional set of numbers but instead be a more qualitative and rounded assessment.</p><h3 id="resources">Resources</h3><p>The direction in the Ministerial Code that the estimate of a cost of a proposal should be included in the memorandum submitted to Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee applies equally to military operations. When evaluating military options it is appropriate to consider financial risk alongside other forms of risk. While governments will rarely wish to preclude options solely on the basis of cost, they must also recognise that, over time, cost may become an issue and make it difficult to sustain a military operation over the longer term.</p><p>Strategies and plans must define the resources required to deliver objectives, identify the budget(s) that will provide those resources, and confirm that those resources are available.</p><p>In developing strategies and plans for civilian/military operations, a government should address the impact of the different mechanisms used to fund military operations and civilian activities and the extent to which those mechanisms provide perverse incentives for military action by making it easier to secure funding for agreed military operations than for civilian activities.</p><p>A government should also address its explicit and implicit financial policy that, while there should be no constraint on the provision of funding for military operations, it is reasonable that for the same civilian/military operation, departments should find funding for new civilian activities from within their existing budgets, which are likely to be fully allocated to existing departmental priorities.</p><p>A government is likely to embark on major civilian/military operations such as Iraq only rarely.</p><p>A government should recognise that, in such operations, the civilian components (including diplomatic activity, reconstruction and Security Sector Reform) will be critical for strategic success, may be very substantial, and must be properly resourced.</p><p>One arrangement would be to create a budget for the civilian components of the operation, under the direction of a senior Minister with lead responsibility and in support of a coherent UK strategy. Once allocations were made from that budget to individual departments, the allocations would be managed within departments' legal and policy constraints. Such an arrangement should:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>ensure that UK strategy was resourced;</p></li><li><p>promote joint working;</p></li><li><p>minimise the potential for gaming;</p></li><li><p>be able to respond to in-year priorities; and</p></li><li><p>reduce the amount of time that Ministers and senior officials need to spend arguing about funding individual activities.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>The Inquiry recognises that, since 2003, significant changes have been made to the UK's strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation, including to the arrangements for funding such operations.</p><h3 id="military-equipment-postconflict">Military equipment (post-conflict)</h3><p>In deciding to undertake concurrent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the UK knowingly exceeded the Defence Planning Assumptions. All resources from that point onwards were going to be stretched. Any decision which commits the UK to extended operations in excess of the Defence Planning Assumptions should be based on the most rigorous analysis of its potential implications, including for the availability of relevant capabilities for UK forces.</p><p>At the start of Op TELIC, the MOD knew that it had capability gaps in relation to protected mobility and ISTAR and that either could have a significant impact on operations. Known gaps in such capabilities should always be clearly communicated to Ministers.</p><p>The MOD should be pro-active in seeking to understand and articulate new or additional equipment requirements. The MOD told the Inquiry that there was no simple answer to the question of where the primary responsibility for identifying capability gaps lay during Op TELIC. That is unacceptable. The roles and responsibilities for identifying and articulating capability gaps in enduring operations must be clearly defined, communicated and understood by those concerned. It is possible that this has been addressed after the period covered by this Inquiry.</p><p>Those responsible for making decisions on the investment in military capabilities should continually evaluate whether the balance between current operational requirements and long-term defence programmes is right, particularly to meet an evolving threat on current operations.</p><p>During the first four years of Op TELIC, there was no clear statement of policy setting out the acceptable level of risk to UK forces and who was responsible for managing that risk. The MOD has suggested to the Inquiry that successive policies defining risk ownership and governance more clearly have addressed that absence, and that wider MOD risk management processes have also been revised. In any future operation the level of force protection required to meet the assessed threat needs to be addressed explicitly.</p><h3 id="civilian-personnel">Civilian personnel</h3><p>The Inquiry recognises that, since 2003, significant changes have been made to the UK's strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation. Some of those changes, including the establishment of a deployable UK civilian stand-by capability, are the direct result of lessons learned from serious shortcomings in the deployment of civilian personnel in post-conflict Iraq.</p><p>The effectiveness of the UK civilian effort in post-conflict Iraq was compromised by a range of factors, including the absence of effective cross-government co-ordination on risk, duty of care and the terms and conditions applicable to personnel serving in Iraq.</p><p>The difficult working conditions for civilians in Iraq were reflected in short tour lengths and frequent leave breaks. Different departments adopted different arrangements throughout the Iraq campaign, leading to concerns about breaks in continuity, loss of momentum, lack of institutional memory and insufficient local knowledge.</p><p>Different departments will continue to deploy civilian staff in different roles. Standardisation of all aspects of those deployments may not be appropriate, but greater harmonisation of departmental policies should be considered wherever possible. The same approach should be applied to locally engaged (LE) staff.</p><p>At all stages, including planning, departments must give full consideration to their responsibilities and duty of care towards LE staff, who have an essential contribution to make and will face particular risks in insecure environments.</p><p>All civilian deployments should be assessed and reviewed against a single, rigorous, cross-government framework for risk management. The framework should provide the means for the Government as a whole to strike an effective balance between security and operational effectiveness, and to take timely decisions on the provision of appropriate security measures.</p><p>Standardising tour lengths for civilians deployed by different departments would have eased the overall administrative burden and, perhaps, some of the tensions between individuals from different government departments serving in Iraq. But the environment was difficult and individuals' resilience and circumstances varied. The introduction of the option to extend a tour of duty was an appropriate response.</p><p>Throughout any operation of this kind, departments should maintain two procedures for the systematic debriefing of staff returning to the UK: one to meet duty of care obligations, the other to learn lessons from their experience.</p><p>In order to identify individuals with the right skills, there must be clarity about the roles they are to perform. Wherever possible, individuals should be recruited for and deployed to clearly defined roles appropriate to their skills and seniority. They must be provided with the equipment needed to perform those roles to a high standard.</p><p>The Government should consider the introduction of a mechanism for responding to a surge in demand for a particular language capability.</p><p>The Inquiry views the inability of the FCO, the MOD and DFID to confirm how many civilian personnel were deployed to or employed in Iraq, in which locations and in what roles, as a serious failure. Data management systems must provide accurate information on the names, roles and locations of all staff for whom departments have duty of care responsibilities.</p><mbp:pagebreak><mbp:section><h2
