The issue of the potential pressure on Service Personnel was not a consideration in the decision.</p></li><li><p>The MOD planned and prepared effectively to provide medical care in support of Operation TELIC.</p></li><li><p>There were major improvements in the provision of medical care, mental healthcare and rehabilitative care available to Service Personnel over the course of Op TELIC.</p></li><li><p>Most of the contacts between the MOD and bereaved families were conducted with sensitivity. In a few cases, they were not. The MOD progressively improved how it engaged with and supported bereaved families, in part driven by consistent public and Ministerial pressure.</p></li><li><p>The Government's decision in 2006 to deploy a second medium scale force to Helmand province in Afghanistan further increased the pressure on Service Personnel, on elements of the MOD's welfare, medical and investigative systems, and the coronial system.</p></li><li><p>Much of the MOD's and the Government's effort from 2006 was focused on addressing those pressures.</p></li><li><p>The MOD should have planned and prepared to address those pressures, rather than react to them.</p></li><li><p>The Government should have acted sooner to address the backlog of inquests into the deaths of Service Personnel. The support it did provide, in June 2006, cleared the backlog.</p></li><li><p>The MOD made a number of improvements to the Board of Inquiry process, but some proposals for more substantive reform (including the introduction of an independent member) were not fully explored. The MOD significantly improved the way it communicated with and supported bereaved families in relation to military investigations and inquests.</p></li><li><p>The MOD was less effective at providing support to Service Personnel who were mobilised individually (a category which included almost all Reservists) and their families, than to formed units.</p></li></ul><span class="hidden-md hidden-lg cite-inline"><span><a class="cite-link cite-copy " href="#12.9170.phkct.8jfnb.nbhad.kjzbo" id="987" para_tag="None">Get Link</a></span></span><p></p></div></div><a class="anchor linkable" id="12g988" name="civilian-casualties"></a><h2>Civilian casualties</h2><a class="anchor" end_key="u2g1c" key="mlo3k" last_title="12" letter_key="huuip" name="988" para_tag="824" parent="12" position_key="3472" start_key="wlhvv"></a><div class="row content-row " id="988"><div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm col-md-offset-1 col-md-1 side-bar" id="988"><a class="cite-link cite-copy" href="#12.3472.mlo3k.wlhvv.u2g1c.huuip" id="988" para_tag="824">824</a></div><div class="col-md-8 "><p><span class="content" id="988">The following key findings are from Section 17:</span> <span class="hidden-md hidden-lg cite-inline"><span><a class="cite-link cite-copy " href="#12.3472.mlo3k.wlhvv.u2g1c.huuip" id="988" para_tag="824">Get Link</a></span></span></p></div></div><a class="anchor" end_key="sxums" key="jzasa" last_title="988" letter_key="lqbee" name="989" page_tag="128" parent="12" position_key="8717" start_key="lpqsu"></a><div class="row content-row " id="989"><div class="hidden-xs hidden-sm col-md-offset-1 col-md-1 side-bar" id="989"><a class="cite-link cite-copy" href="#12.8717.jzasa.lpqsu.sxums.lqbee" id="989" para_tag="None">Get Link</a> <br/>p. 128</div><div class="col-md-8 "><p><span class="content" id="989"></span></p><ul><li><p>The Inquiry considers that a Government has a responsibility to make every reasonable effort to understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions on civilians.</p></li><li><p>In the months before the invasion, Mr Blair emphasised the need to minimise the number of civilian casualties arising from an invasion of Iraq.
